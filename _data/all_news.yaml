    Ebola has killed gorillas
     and chimps, experts claim
     Ebola   is currently the single greatest threat to the survival of gorillas and   chimpanzees, having killed off a third of their populations since the   1990s, scientists claim.  The virus is even more deadly to great apes that it is for   humans, with mortality rates as high as 95 per cent for gorillas and 77 per cent for   chimpanzees.
