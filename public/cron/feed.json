That notion might seem far fetched at the moment.<\/p><p>But wearable and portable health devices could soon take on a growing number of duties currently unnecessarily performed by clinicians. That in itself is not bad news considering that Kenya faces a biting shortage of medics.<\/p><p>Think of a smart watch that quietly monitors your heart rate, activity, blood pressure and sleep patterns to prevent chronic diseases. <\/p><p>Or a mobile phone-like device that uses a drop of your blood to produce about ten lab-quality results on the spot, and send that information to your doctor.<\/p><p>Experts predict that in the not-too-distant future medical advances will have us shaking our heads in wonder at how we ever survived without them \u2013 like, imagine how Kenyans survived without Mpesa.<\/p><p>Some of these devices are already turning science fiction into science fact.

According to ABI Research, a firm that monitors medical innovations, wearable wireless medical device sales will reach more than 100 million devices annually by 2017.<\/p><p>\"A growing number of medical devices are becoming wearable, including glucose monitors, ECG monitors, pulse oximeters, and blood pressure monitors,\" Theo Ahadome, senior analyst at IMS Research, says in the report. <\/p><p>Here are some out of the innovations to watch out for. Some of this stuff is here already, and the future is calling.<\/p><p>Philips PulseRelief<\/p><p>This is an app-enabled TENS (Trancutaneous Electronic Nerve Stimulation) device that helps users choose and control personal treatment to relieve pain without the use of drugs. The small patch, worn discreetly near the shoulder, allows pain suffers to control their pain relief device, choose their treatment and keep track of their treatments in a diary. It can be used in specific parts of their body like the back, shoulder, elbow, arms and legs.<\/p><p> <span>BlueTouch<\/span><\/p><p>Low back pain is rapidly becoming a major common work-related injury in Kenya. The Philips Bluetouch is a strap worn around the back and uses blue LED light to stimulate the natural healing of the body and reduce pain without medication. It uses blue light therapy to help relieve muscular back pain with a dual effect: delivering warmth and stimulating the release of the body\u2019s own nitric oxide. The result is locally increased blood flow that supports the body\u2019s natural recovery processes.<\/p><p> <span>VISIQ Ultrasound<\/span><\/p><p>Imagine seeing a high quality image of your unborn baby, whether you live in Nairobi or a remote village in Tana River. <\/p><p>This Visiq portable transducer-plus-tablet system delivers high-quality ultrasound images without the need for large ultrasound machines. It looks like a small tablet and a mouse. It was launched in Kenya in June last year and is hoped to help reduce maternal deaths by 40 per cent. At least 7,000 women in Kenya die from pregnancy related complications every year, according to the ministry of health. <\/p><p>The manufacturer said the gadget performs two-and-a-half hours of continuous scanning on one battery charge. During its development, five generations of mock-ups were tested extensively with customers in Kenya, US, Uganda, India, China, Germany, and Indonesia. <\/p><p>The device will retail at Sh1.4 million.

Usually, community health workers manually count how many breaths a child takes in the span of one minute. But the Charm converts chest movements detected by accelerometers into accurate breathing counts, using standard algorithms to diagnose fast breathing rates, tailored to the way children\u2019s chests move during breathing. <\/p><p>Accurate diagnosis ensures that children with pneumonia receive the antibiotics they need, potentially preventing many of the deaths.

Because of the condition, Gloria also\nhas a bit of pelvic problems whereby the muscles don\u2019t work very\nwell because part of the rectum protrudes out, and we are trying to\nprevent that,\u201d Dr Hansen explains.

Dr Mohamed Jeilan, a cardiologist at the hospital's heart and cancer centre, said: \u201cAmong heart attack patients with blocked coronary arteries, balloon expansion (or angioplasty) at the site of blockage has been the mainstay of treatment for more than two decades.\u201d But in many patients, the vessel wall is hardened and the blockages are very long. In these patients, balloon inflation is unable to relieve the obstruction. <\/p><p>So medics at Aga Khan delivered a miniature \u2018rotablator\u2019 drill (less than 1.5mm wide) which was small enough to fit into the thin heart vessels to bore open the artery. The drill is coated with tiny pieces of diamond crystal and is used in a catheter based procedure called rotational atherectomy. \"A specially designed diamond burr is used to grind away the blockage, rotating at more than 150,000 times per second,\" Dr Jeilan said.<\/p><p>As it spins, it pushes against the wall of the blood vessels, grinding down the deposits into fragments that are so small they can be absorbed by the body and flushed out via the kidneys. <\/p><p>With coronary artery disease continuing to affect more Kenyans, the hospital said it will continue to foster new technologies and therapies that have proved successful in other parts of the world.Commenting on the impact of this treatment and its significance in the region, Dr Anders Barasa, consultant cardiologist at the hospital added: \u201cThis unique and technically advanced method is safe and effective and can be performed with little risk in the right hands. It has already been used in more than 50,000 cases worldwide and will now also benefit the population here and help define Nairobi as the capital of cardiovascular care in the region.\u201d<\/p><p>The procedure started being used across the world mainly in 2007. It is mostly ideal for patients who have heavily calcified plaque blockages, which other technology cannot remove because the calcification is too hard.<\/p><p>Those with diabetes, kidney failure or who are heavy smokers are the best candidates. <\/p>","newsitem_id":"1250359","section_id":"24","sorted_tags":["Artery","Atherosclerosis","Heart","Coronary circulation","Cardiology","Angina pectoris","Atheroma","Coronary artery disease"],"theme":{"Artery":"0.957603","Atherosclerosis":"0.836262","Heart":"0.789211","Coronary circulation":"0.78326","Cardiology":"0.665752","Angina pectoris":"0.603272","Atheroma":"0.590761","Coronary artery disease":"0.583458"}}}],"tags":{"Health care":4,"Medicine":2,"Pain":1,"Blood":2,"Kenya":4,"Myocardial infarction":1,"Fisherman":2,"Lake Victoria":1,"Fishing":1,"AIDS":1,"Homa Bay":1,"Nyanza Province":1,"Antiretroviral drug":1,"Epidemiology":1,"Africa":1,"Death":1,"Community":1,"Nairobi":1,"Nursing":1,"Cancer":2,"Breast cancer":1,"Metastasis":1,"Cervical cancer":1,"Nurse":1,"Raila Odinga":1,"Chemotherapy":1,"Leukemia":1,"Bone marrow":1,"National identification number":1,"Hematology":1,"Identity theft":1,"Polio vaccine":1,"Vaccine":1,"Tuberculosis":1,"Public health":1,"Poliomyelitis eradication":1,"World Health Organization":1,"Illness":1,"Female":1,"Violence against women":2,"Domestic violence":1,"Woman":1,"Girl":1,"Gender":1,"Boy":1,"Family planning":1,"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation":2,"Bill Gates":1,"Million":1,"Birth control":1,"Duke University":1,"Abortion":1,"Urinary bladder":1,"Urinary system":1,"Ureter":1,"Urology":1,"Urine":1,"Peritoneum":1,"Artery":1,"Atherosclerosis":1,"Heart":1,"Coronary circulation":1,"Cardiology":1,"Angina pectoris":1,"Atheroma":1,"Coronary artery disease":1}}
