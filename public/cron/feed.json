Dr Mohamed Jeilan, a cardiologist at the hospital's heart and cancer centre, said: \u201cAmong heart attack patients with blocked coronary arteries, balloon expansion (or angioplasty) at the site of blockage has been the mainstay of treatment for more than two decades.\u201d But in many patients, the vessel wall is hardened and the blockages are very long. In these patients, balloon inflation is unable to relieve the obstruction. <\/p><p>So medics at Aga Khan delivered a miniature \u2018rotablator\u2019 drill (less than 1.5mm wide) which was small enough to fit into the thin heart vessels to bore open the artery. The drill is coated with tiny pieces of diamond crystal and is used in a catheter based procedure called rotational atherectomy. \"A specially designed diamond burr is used to grind away the blockage, rotating at more than 150,000 times per second,\" Dr Jeilan said.<\/p><p>As it spins, it pushes against the wall of the blood vessels, grinding down the deposits into fragments that are so small they can be absorbed by the body and flushed out via the kidneys. <\/p><p>With coronary artery disease continuing to affect more Kenyans, the hospital said it will continue to foster new technologies and therapies that have proved successful in other parts of the world.Commenting on the impact of this treatment and its significance in the region, Dr Anders Barasa, consultant cardiologist at the hospital added: \u201cThis unique and technically advanced method is safe and effective and can be performed with little risk in the right hands. It has already been used in more than 50,000 cases worldwide and will now also benefit the population here and help define Nairobi as the capital of cardiovascular care in the region.\u201d<\/p><p>The procedure started being used across the world mainly in 2007. It is mostly ideal for patients who have heavily calcified plaque blockages, which other technology cannot remove because the calcification is too hard.<\/p><p>Those with diabetes, kidney failure or who are heavy smokers are the best candidates. <\/p>","newsitem_id":"1250359","section_id":"24","sorted_tags":["Artery","Atherosclerosis","Heart","Coronary circulation","Cardiology","Angina pectoris","Atheroma","Coronary artery disease"],"theme":{"Artery":"0.957603","Atherosclerosis":"0.836262","Heart":"0.789211","Coronary circulation":"0.78326","Cardiology":"0.665752","Angina pectoris":"0.603272","Atheroma":"0.590761","Coronary artery disease":"0.583458"}}},{"node":{"nid":"117441","type":"article","title":"THE WEEK","byline":"TRACY MUTINDA","date":"2015-11-29 21:00:00","image":null,"body":"<strong>Nearly all TB patients <\/strong><strong>tested for HIV infection<\/strong><p>Among persons living with HIV in Kenya, tuberculosis (TB) is the single leading cause of death. With more than 35 per cent of those with TB infected with HIV, TB and HIV coinfection creates a substantial burden on Kenya\u2019s health system and among patients, their families, and local communities. Leading many other high burden countries, Kenya now tests over 95 per cent of TB patients for HIV and provides antiretroviral therapy (ART) to over 86% of people who have both TB and HIV. <\/p><p>With support of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Kenya is addressing the quality of TB screening, expanding access to new TB diagnostics, and on World TB Day 2015 is launching a national program to provide a drug called isoniazid to prevent TB among people living with HIV. Detecting TB among HIV patients is essential to reducing illness and death. In 2005 Kenya implemented HIV testing for all TB patients. By 2013, HIV testing had been scaled up to reach over 95% of all TB patients who are in care. Then in 2009, with PEPFAR support, the country began intensified TB case finding among people living with HIV. They used symptom-based screening and, by 2014, over 90% of HIV patients were screened for TB on their last clinical visit.<\/p><p><strong>HIV new infections <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>lowest in 15 years<\/strong><\/p><p>The latest global report on HIV-AIDS shows promising trends in controlling the epidemic, but some hurdles remain in improving access to life-saving treatmentsA new report from UNAIDS in advance of World AIDS Day tomorrow shows some impressive progress in the fight against HIV. There were 2 million new HIV infections around the world in 2014\u201315, the lowest since 2000, when 3.1 million people worldwide were diagnosed with HIV. Deaths from AIDS, the last stages of HIV infection, are also coming down, from a high of 2 million in the early 2000s to 1.2 million this year.<\/p><p>Much of that can be attributed to improved access to life-saving treatments with antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). In Kenya, 50 per cent of people who are HIV positive are now being treated. In Sub Saharan Africa, new infections dropped by 41% since 2000, and AIDS-related deaths declined by 48%. The report doesn't give Kenya specific figures. In this region, nearly half of the 25.8 million people living with HIV are women, and that increases the risk that, if they become pregnant, they will pass along the infection to their children. Drug treatments can significantly reduce the risk of transmission during birth, but not all women in the area have adequate prenatal and reproductive health care.<\/p><strong>Busia Governor threatens <\/strong><strong>to sack striking medics<\/strong>Striking health workers risk losing their jobs if they do not resume work.

Their job is a calling, which doesn\u2019t warrant exposing the lives of innocent patients to danger,\u201d he said.The governor said he was not out to sack anyone but if need be, he would not hesitate to do so so as to avoid more suffering among patients.

She could not play with other children and had vomited.<\/p><p>Princess Josephine Nyambura was always playful. When Macharia returned home weary each night, she insisted on them playing games before he could rest.<\/p><p>But now she appeared haggard and dizzy.<\/p><p>Macharia and his wife, Caroline Mukiri, took her to Kiambu General Hospital, where doctors said she was anaemic and prescribed some boosters.<\/p><p>Later, the then three-year-old\u2019s lymph nodes started swelling. She was transferred to Kenyatta National Hospital and was immediately put on oxygen for three weeks.<\/p><p>\u201cUnfortunately this is the time KNH nurses went on strike. After the three weeks, I just wrote a letter asking them to release my daughter,\u201d Macharia, 33, says.<\/p><p>By then, Princess had lost weight, her skin turned pale and her stomach started to swell.<\/p><p>She was admitted in three more hospitals. Medics at KNH eventually resumed work and Princess was taken back there in September last year.<\/p><p>After a battery of tests, doctors calmly announced to her parents their daughter had leukaemia, a cancer of the blood-forming cells.<\/p><p>Macharia says they took the grim news in stride. \u201cWe finally could tell what was destroying our daughter,\u201d he says.<\/p><p>Most patients with leukaemia are treated with chemotherapy. Some may need expensive bone marrow transplant.<\/p><p>The treatment can often control the disease and its symptoms, but chronic leukaemia is rarely cured.<\/p><p>Doctors say there is only a 25 to 30 per cent chance that Princess will be cured. The terrifying scenario that Macharia might lose his only child plays out in his mind every day.<\/p><p>But he is steadfastly hanging on to the 25-30 per cent chance. \u201cPrincess has a strong will and one day on phone, she told me not to worry. She told me, \u2018Daddy, sitakufa (Daddy, I will not die)\u2019. These words have kept me going,\u201d Macharia says.<\/p><p>Dr Peter Maturi, a consultant haematologist who attended to Princess, says she has high-risk leukaemia and local doctors have run out of options. \u201cShe requires further treatment, which is not available locally,\u201d he says.<\/p><p>Maturi advised the family to seek bone marrow treatment in India.<\/p><p>Hope For Cancer Kids, a cancer awareness NGO in Nairobi, says leukaemia is the second most common form of the disease among children. Only one in 10 children survive cancer in Kenya, compared to seven in 10 in the developed countries, says the organisation led by James Munge and Dr Esther Munyoro.<\/p><p>Bone marrow transplant, which Princess requires, is often listed as the third most expensive medical operation after intestinal and heart transplants.<\/p><p>The first hospital Macharia and Caroline contacted returned a quotation of Sh9.3 million.<\/p><p>Finding a donor for a bone marrow transplant is difficult, and complications after the procedure are common. There is also a lengthy prep time in hospital as well as an extensive recovery period, resulting in a hefty medical bill.<\/p><p>Artemis Hospital in New Delhi subsidised the cost to Sh7.5 million. Princess and her mother flew to India last month.<\/p><p>Before his daughter\u2019s sickness, Macharia had been promoted to a marketing manager of a water company in Nairobi.<\/p><p>He had also upgraded his private business, the Princess Mash Caterer\u2019s Hotel in Githurai Estate.<\/p><p>However, the diagnosis and financial burden that followed have taken a toll on him. Macharia left the job, closed his hotel and sold everything he could lay his hands on. <\/p><p>He has already spent more than Sh5 million since last year, including donations from well-wishers. Artemis hospital now requires at least Sh4 million from him to proceed with the transplant.<\/p><p>Dr Vikas Dua, a senior consultant in haematology at the Indian Hospital, says Princess has completed chemotherapy and requires the bone marrow transplant urgently.<\/p><p>\u201cThe chances of cure are around 25 per cent to 30 per cent only,\u201d he says. <\/p><p>The family has secured paybill number 563 596, where donors can enter their own national ID number as the account number.

There are so many subtle signs it gives us, that picking up on them - and being attuned to what is normal for you - is vital to feeling well and preventing future problems.\u201d<\/p><p>From yellow spots on the elbows to itchy feet, here she explains how to tell if something is up with your health.<\/p><p>1. Gaining weigh around the waist<\/p><p>Have you gone shopping for a new pair of jeans and realise that your waist size has gone up? It can put you at risk of developing diabetes and a condition called the metabolic syndrome if it is higher than 80cm for women or 94cm for men.<\/p><p>The risk is substantially higher if the waist is bigger than 88cm for women or 102cm for men.<\/p><p>With high rates of obesity and associated waist circumference, diabetes, which gives us problems with tiredness, concentration, frequent urinating and drinking water short term, and in the long term can affect our vision, circulation and life expectancy is common.<\/p><p>Regular exercise and a good diet can keep this in check but talk to your doctor about a test for Type-2 diabetes.<\/p><p>2. Yellow spots around your eyes and\/or your elbows<\/p><p>This is a condition known as xanthelasma and is due to fatty deposits just under your skin. It can be sign that your cholesterol level is raised.<\/p><p>A blood test, usually done on a empty stomach, can tell if that is the case. Depending on the cause of this, dietary interventions and exercise can help to reduce this.<\/p><p>We get concerned about cholesterol because it can be a risk factor for developing problems with the heart or brain such as a heart attack or stroke respectively.<\/p><p>3. You have darker circles around your eyes<\/p><p>Though not getting enough sleep can contribute to this, dark circles could also be due to allergies and frequently itching of the eyes or rubbing the nose.<\/p><p>Working out what they could be, for example, house dust mites, and limiting your exposure may help. If the itching is frequent, anti-allergy medications may help.<\/p><p>Research suggests probiotics may help to alleviate some allergies.<\/p><p>4. Itchy feet<\/p><p>Spending time in sweaty trainers at the gym or swimming often? The damp environment can increase fungal infections, causing the feet to itch. You may notice a white scaly or damp rash in between your toes or under the feet.<\/p><p>An anti-fungal cream, usually available over the counter can help to treat this. Good hygiene and airing the feet out as often as possible helps with healing and preventing a recurrence.<\/p><p>5. Cracks at the corners of your mouth<\/p><p>This is usually your body telling you to increase your intake of foods rich in B vitamins and iron such as leafy green vegetables, lean meat and eggs.<\/p><p>Once dry and cracked, this can become infected. Topical treatment and moisturising usually clears it.<\/p><p>6. Very itchy rash<\/p><p>This can be a sign of coeliac disease especially if it doesn\u2019t improve despite using creams available over the counter.<\/p><p>This is a gluten-sensitivity condition whereby the body reacts to the gluten protein in food. This affects the lining of the gut, making it difficult to absorb nutrients. The skin can therefore be affected.<\/p><p>In the long run and depending on the severity, it can cause chronic damage to the bowels.<\/p><p>Your doctor can do a simple blood test for coeliac disease and if positive, you can purchase gluten-free food on prescription.<\/p><p>7. Thinning hair<\/p><p>Your iron levels may be low. This can be problematic for women especially as we may be health conscious and refrain from animal products rich in iron. Furthermore we lose iron monthly and therefore can become anaemic. Having a thyroid problem can also affect the hair.<\/p><p>A blood test can tell if its due to these problems. Increasing iron rich foods or taking a supplement if its low can help.<\/p><p>8. Brittle nails<\/p><p>This usually happens if we over-expose the nails to wet, damp conditions or frequently use nail polish.<\/p><p>Moisturising the nails regularly can help and using a supplement with biotin (vitamin b7) may be effective. It can sometimes be a sign of a fungal infection, psoriasis, thyroid problems, or arthritis. <\/p><p>If this is so, seek advice from a doctor. <\/p><p>If due to these conditions, one would usually have other symptoms such as a rash, fatigue, painful joints respectively. Do seek advice from your doctor.<\/p><p>9. Constipation<\/p><p>This is your body telling you to increase the fibre and water in your diet.<\/p><p>Most people don\u2019t get close to the recommended intake of fibre in their daily diet. The type of fibre is also important to prevent constipation and excess wind or bloating.<\/p><p>We need both insoluble (such as wheatbran, whole-grains) and soluble fibres (including oatbran and pulses) to prevent constipation and help decrease cholesterol levels respectively.<\/p><p>Soluble fibres are more likely to cause wind and bloating, however gradually building up your intake of both types can prevent this from being problematic.<\/p><p>If it does happen, the body gradually <\/p><p>\u2013 Daily Mail<\/p>","newsitem_id":"1220067","section_id":"24","sorted_tags":["Coeliac disease","Leaf vegetable","Nutrition","Gluten-free diet","Gluten-free diet","Term","Biotin","Mycosis"],"theme":{"Coeliac disease":"0.944602","Leaf vegetable":"0.912388","Nutrition":"0.843728","Gluten-free diet":"0.843366","Gluten":"0.812485","Term":"0.769595","Biotin":"0.707358","Mycosis":"0.707203"}}},{"node":{"nid":"118135","type":"article","title":"Embu setting up sh240m kidney centre","byline":"BY MUOKI CHARLES ","date":"2015-11-23 03:00:00","image":"http:\/\/www.the-star.co.ke\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/mobile_app\/public\/articles\/2015\/11\/23\/1243077.jpg?itok=WGfoeJXY|ALT|First Lady Margaret Kenyatta and Embu Governor Martin Nyaga Wambora in Embu when the First Lady Presented the Beyond Zero Mobile clinic.

Photo\/Monicah Mwangi","body":"<p>When growing up, Lea Kilenga knew she was different. \u201cI was not like the others in my class. I had a much smaller body, attended class less frequently and I was treated like I was \u2018special\u2019,\u201d she says.<\/p><p>Lea was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia at three months. Born in a family of four children, she was the third child diagnosed with the disease. \u201cMy two older sisters also had sickle cell. This was clear from the physical appearance of our bodies,\u201d she remembers.<\/p><p>Sickle Cell is a genetic disorder that deforms the normal round red blood cells into sickle shaped red blood cells.<\/p><p>It is one of the most common inherited diseases. There is no current research to identify how many people have sickle cell in Kenya with the only available statistics dating back to 1954.<\/p><p>Prof Jessie Githanga, a hematologist at Kenyatta National Hospital, says sickle cell is caused by the inheritance of abnormal haemoglobin. He says the true magnitude of the disease has not been determined and many children probably die before being diagnosed.<\/p><p>There is a high prevalence of the sickle-cell haemoglobin gene in malaria endemic regions. \u201cThe prevalence of sickle cell trait amongst different ethnic groups in Kenya have been determined.<\/p><p>The regions with highest sickle cell traits are coast (up to 35 per cent among the Kambe community) and Western Kenya (up to 28 per cent in Luo community).<\/p><p>Pain, known as crisis, is the main characteristic that defines sickle cell. It manifests itself mostly in the long limbs and moves to the entire body. It\u2019s an acute or chronic pain that varies from person to person.<\/p><p>\u201cThis is the kind of feeling that doesn\u2019t go away easily. The kind that creeps up unexpectedly, takes over and handicaps your body and mind,\u201d says Lea.<\/p><p>Githanga says pain can strike almost anywhere in the body and in more than one spot at a time. He adds that the pain often occurs in the lower back, legs, arms, abdomen and chest. \u201cThe crisis can be triggered by illnesses, temperature changes, stress, dehydration and being at high altitudes. Other complications include stroke, eye problems, kidney disease, gall bladder stones, priapism (prolonged painful penile erection in males) and liver disease among others,\u201d Githanga adds.<\/p><p>Pain had become a part of Lea\u2019s childhood and she was hospitalised many times, with daily medication. She also witnessed the pain her older sisters went through. Lea vividly recalls painful moments before her gall bladder was surgically removed.<\/p><p>\u201cBefore the surgery was done, I spent most of my nights beside the toilet bowl. This pain was like an intense hot rock in my stomach that couldn\u2019t allow me to swallow anything. That feeling could only be quantified to that of a red hot metal rod stab through the upper part of my stomach all through to my back,\u201d she remembers.<\/p><p>Watching her sisters in pain was however much worse. \u201cFor some reason it seemed like their particular kind of pain was much worse. I remember a time when my older sister was in constant anguish. All I could hear were cries from her room where she lay almost lifeless.\u201d<\/p><p>She says their house was filled with echoes and screams of discomfort and sometimes long absences to the hospital. Her elder sister eventually succumbed to the disease. \u201cAt the age of four, I didn\u2019t realise what had happened. All I noticed was the silence and the empty bed. I only fully came to understand what sickle cell was at the age of 14.\u201d<\/p><p>In school, she noticed how the teachers whispered whenever she was present. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be too hard on that one, they don\u2019t live very long,\u201d she remembers one teacher murmuring. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t think the conversation was about me but soon after, most of the teachers at the school began leaving me out from class punishments and games. The situation got worse when the students learnt I had \u201csomething\u201d! No one knew enough about sickle cell, so everyone assumed the worst,\u201d she says.<\/p><p>The pupils believed it was contagious. \u201cNo one spoke to me, sat next to me or even touched anything I owned. Walking to and from the playground was a lonely affair. Every time I tried to approach or speak to anyone, they walked away,\u201d she remembers.<\/p><p>She was lucky to have her parents\u2019 support and they taught her how to win the pain. \u201cNever in all my life on the hospital bed did I see them tire or crack under pressure. I especially loved their ability to see beyond the tears and the heartache. Raising three children with sickle cell meant that they had to accept the pain that came with it.\u201d<\/p><p>In high school, Lea got herself into performing arts and drama which she says helped her regain her confidence and self esteem.<\/p><p>Two years ago, the 26 year embarked on an ambitious 10003 Warrior Project, a photographic narrative that she hopes will enable her capture 10, 003 real-time portraits and stories of sickle cell warriors around the country.<\/p><p>The project is also a platform that encourages a healthier lifestyle for sickle cell disease management as well as raises awareness.<\/p><p>\u201cAllowing myself to speak up has given me the strength to meet sickle cell warriors. To share with them my experiences and create a safe space that allows them to gain their voices and speak,\u201d she said.<\/p><p>The project, which is predominantly web based and social media centred, is expected to help Lea publish a warrior photo book and finally create a documentary on sickle cell in Kenya.<\/p><p>Ruth Auma is another sickle cell patient. Ruth, 34, dropped out of school due to severe crisis. \u201cI think I had the worst child life.

But as you draw closer, instead of tiered spectator seats, you have lush vegetation covering the well-kept rice paddies. <\/p><p>This is Mwea irrigation scheme, which produces 80 per cent of all rice grown in Kenya. On the edges of the scheme are the hundreds of farmers who supply Kenya with their beloved Pishori rice.<\/p><p>One of them is Lucia Kameni, a 52-year-old mother who has been grounded by a debilitating form of diabetes.<\/p><p>Lucia lives in a creaky mud house in Gitutu, a sprawling village of rice growers near Mwea Town in Kirinyaga County. Most of them have little to show for their decades of labour.<\/p><p>She shares income from her farm with her two sons and two grandchildren from a late daughter.<\/p><p>While diabetes is largely manageable, the costs are not. \u201cI spend about Sh4,000 every month on diabetes drugs. Many times I do not have the money but I borrow drugs from other villagers,\u201d she says.<\/p><p>The disease \u2013 in which the body\u2019s inability to produce any or enough insulin causes dangerously high levels of sugar in the blood \u2013 has hit Mwea residents hard.<\/p><p>Lucia says nearly every family has someone who is diabetic. Many of them also suffer high blood pressure.<\/p><p>Medics at the nearby Our Lady of Lourdes Karira Hospital say the two conditions are rampant and expensive to manage.<\/p><p>There are no studies to establish why an unusually large number of Mwea residents are developing diabetes.<\/p><p>Some medics point to a March 2012 Harvard study which showed that eating white rice regularly, as is commonly done in Kirinyaga, may increase risk for developing type 2 diabetes \u2013 the type most closely linked to obesity.<\/p><p>The findings, published in the journal BMJ, said this was probably because white rice ranks high on the glycemic index, which means it can cause a sudden spike in blood sugar levels. It is also low in fiber that can help lower the risk for developing diabetes.<\/p><p>Mary Wangari, a neighbour of Lucia, says had always felt dizzy but dismissed that as flu. She was diagnosed with diabetes last year. <\/p><p>The 65-year-old also developed high blood pressure and is on wheelchair. She repairs clothes to take care of herself and her three children. <\/p><p>Wangari buys diabetes drugs from a chemist in Mwea, only when she has money. \u201cThe most I have ever bought were drugs for one week,\u201d she says. The expenses, including hospital visits, go beyond Sh4,000 on some months.<\/p><p>The two expect to be among the first beneficiaries of Novartis Access, an initiative for cheaper drugs for non-communicable diseases announced by the drugs manufacturer Novartis two weeks ago. <\/p><p>Kenya is the first country to benefit from the portfolio of 15 medicines to treat cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes and breast cancer. <\/p><p>When the drugs arrive, Wangari and Lucia will, incredibly, spend at most Sh150 for a full dose to treat each disease every month.<\/p><p>\u201cThe successful implementation of the programme in Kenya will be essential to guide the expansion of Novartis Access to other countries in the future,\u201d said Novartis chairman Joerg Reinhardt when he visited Kenya two weeks ago. <\/p><p>The company has partnered with the Ministry of Health, the Kenyan Red Cross, and local drugs distributors among others in the programme.<\/p><p>Diabetes, hypertension and other NCDs account for 27 per cent of deaths - almost 100,000 people - in Kenya every year.<\/p><p>Kirinyaga county will be the first to receive the consignment of the cheap drugs anytime this month.<\/p><p>Governor Joseph Ndathi says cancer and diabetes have taken toll on residents. <\/p><p>\u201cWhen people with run out of resources they go to painkillers, so diseases that are curable mutate to other diseases,\u201d he says.<\/p><p>Head of the Novartis Access programme Dr Harald Nusser told the Star the company expects its approach to be commercially sustainable over the long term.<\/p><p>It will also be launched in Ethiopia and Vietnam with further plans to roll it out out to 30 countries depending on demand. <\/p><p>\u201cWe narrowed down to the countries with the highest medical need, where we have certain presence and where health-care system makes the launch feasible and sustainable,\u201d he said. <\/p><p>The access programme comes after the company successfully rolled out the Familia Nawiri (healthy families) project in Kenya in 2007. <\/p><p>Head of the programme in Kenya Antony Gitau says they train local community health workers who then deliver training in schools, churches and chamas (the self-help groups).<\/p><p>The workers teach villagers about good health, hygiene, nutrition, common diseases and disease prevention. <\/p><p>They also arrange health camps with qualified doctors and provide triage services every month.<\/p><p>The results have been impressive. \u201cWe are in 10 counties now and 27 wards.

The study found that six out of every ten teeth which were next to a filling had decayed after just five years - with almost 30 per cent needing filling themselves. Simen Kopperud, of the Nordic Institute of Dental Materials in Oslo, Norway, who led the study, said: \u201cThe most important message is that if restoration takes place in one place the problem of decay is not solved. \u201cIt is highly possible that the intervention by the dentist causes a problem in adjacent teeth.

Upon reaching the clinic in Dandora, Victoria advised Rosemary to cancel the procedure.  &ldquo;It was a shady clinic which my daughter hated at first sight,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>Rosemary returned home and for the next month managed the pain with pain relievers until she was advised by locals to seek treatment from a proper hospital. &ldquo;I went to St Mary&rsquo;s, a missionary hospital in Nairobi where tests were done but nothing was detected.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The doctor advised her to take a second biopsy, which showed she had breast cancer. &ldquo;I could not believe it, and I decided to seek a third opinion which also was positive,&rdquo; she says.<\/p><p>Rosemary went home and cried most of the time for about two weeks. &ldquo;I think the moment one is told has cancer, the situation gets worse. I was in pain all through. I was always absent minded. I cried myself to sleep every night, something I still do to date,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>She went to Kenyatta National Hospital but the earliest appointment for treatment she could get was for late 2017.<\/p><p>She had to seek other opinions. &ldquo;I knew if I had to wait for next year, I would die along the way,&rdquo; says Rosemary, resting on her back to ease her pain.<\/p><p>For the next two months, Rosemary would save money and in September last year she went to a private hospital, where she was advised to undergo chemotherapy.<\/p><p>&ldquo;It has been very expensive for me. God should not give poor people these diseases. I now have to survive on loans and donations from well wishers,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>Rosemary has been paying Sh20,000 for a chemotherapy session at Upperhill Medical Centre compared to the Sh6,000 patients pay at KNH. &ldquo;The last session was done on credit, and now doctors have recommended six more sessions,&rdquo; she says, adding that the breast is too heavy to walk around with.<\/p><p>Rosemary, who is in constant pain, says she was told she has stage four cancer, which is chronic and often terminal. The doctor has advised against having a mastectomy. &ldquo;My right breast is swollen and very stiff,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The doctor said it cannot be cut at the moment.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Her other breast is also swollen and she is worried it could also be infected.<\/p><p>Even after the chemotherapy, Rosemary says she feels worse than when she started. &ldquo;Every time I take those drugs, I don&rsquo;t leave my bed for at least two weeks. It&rsquo;s a very painful experience. See what it has done to my hair,&rdquo; she says, taking off  her head covering to show her shiny bald head.<\/p><p>Rosemary is a mother of three and takes care of six others who are orphans. &ldquo;I am a bread winner to nine children, and I educate all of them.

Kabethi is 72 years old and was diagnosed  with prostate cancer four years ago but only had an operation done last year. &ldquo;They cut off my private parts, I don&rsquo;t have anything,&rdquo; he said, adding that the wound is healed but the pain from within is unbearable.<\/p><p>He tells us the previous day he had gone for his usual clinics at KNH but was told the doctor was not available. He is hopeful that one day he will be completely healed.<\/p><p>Cancer and HIV patients mostly spend their last days of life in severe pain mostly lacking the much needed palliative care.  This care is mostly given to terminally ill patients where strong painkillers are administered along with symptom management, counseling and comfort for the patient. Rosemary says she has been taking diclofenac and panadols to ease her pain. But they are relatively weak painkillers considering the magnitude of cancer pain.<\/p><p>Palliative care nurse at Nairobi Hospice Joyce Wangari says they mostly get patients with stage four cancer. <\/p><p>&ldquo;At this stage, patients need opiods and we mostly administer morphine,&rdquo; she said. They also offer comfort and counseling to the patients. &ldquo;If a patient is referred to us with stage four liver cancer which is as a result of alcoholism, we don&rsquo;t tell them to stop drinking, we let the guy enjoy his drink since the damage is already done and in any case the withdraw will kill him even before the disease. That is why we say palliative care is about comfort,&rdquo; she explained.<\/p><p>According to Zipporah Ali,  head of the Kenya Hospices and Palliative Care Association,  only 10 per cent of people who need palliative care receive it in the country. Zipporah says medics fear prescribing opiods, which are strong pain reliever for fear of addiction and due to strict policies. &ldquo;If a medic is found guilty of prescribing a drug like morphine wrongly, such person can be jailed for up to 10 years,&rdquo; she said, adding that most medics avoid taking such risks.<\/p><p>Zipporah said that Kehpca is working closely with the government to ensure palliative care is incorporated in all government hospitals. <\/p><p>She adds that Kenya requires 400kgs of morphine but only 47kgs was bought by the government last year. &ldquo;Even if those patients eventually die, they should die in dignity,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>Dr Esther Munyoro, head of palliative care unit at KNH, says the unit is doing awareness at the hospital and training nurses on pain management. &ldquo;Morphine is a wonder drug. We are encouraging medics at the accident and emergency unit to send patients in pain to the palliative care unit where they are offered pain relievers as they wait to see the doctors,&rdquo; she said. Munyoro said they want to make KNH a &lsquo;pain-free hospital&rsquo;. &ldquo;Pain is important, it helps us make diagnosis but at the same time, it kills, especially in cancer and HIV patients,&rdquo; said Munyoro.<\/p><p>Early this month, the overworked radiotherapy machine at KNH broke down, forcing the hospital to send away cancer patients. Kenyatta is the only public hospital that treats cancer charging Sh500 per radiotherapy session while private hospital charge between Sh5,000 and Sh10,000.<\/p><p>According to Kenya Cancer Association, 80 Kenyans die of cancer each day. The NGO says 40,000 people are diagnosed with the disease out of whom 30,000 die. Chairman Ann Korir said the number of deaths and diagnoses may be higher as the figures only reflect cases reported to and recorded in hospitals. &ldquo;The majority of those diagnosed with cancer are are women aged between 30 and 49 and men aged between 45 and 50,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women in both developing and developed countries. It is the most prevalent cancer among Kenyan women and constitutes a major public health problem. Although definite prevalence and incidence studies are lacking for Kenya, some estimates indicate that breast cancer accounts for about 23 per cent of all cancers while cervical and prostate cancer represents about 20 per cent.<\/p>","newsitem_id":"1222734","section_id":"24","sorted_tags":["Cancer","Oncology","Breast cancer","Pain","Chemotherapy","Opioid","Breast cancer","Hospital"],"theme":{"Cancer":"0.976898","Oncology":"0.768742","Breast cancer":"0.62881","Pain":"0.590269","Chemotherapy":"0.522249","Opioid":"0.512494","Breast":"0.500954","Hospital":"0.465826"}}},{"node":{"nid":"113878","type":"article","title":"THE WEEK (Health)","byline":"TRACY MUTINDA","date":"2015-10-25 21:00:00","image":null,"body":"<p><strong>Mbeere hospital carries out pioneering surgeries<\/strong><\/p><p>Mbeere Level 4 Hospital, Siakago, has successfully carried out 12 pioneering C-section operations after it was rehabilitated by the Embu county government.

The rise of breast cancer activism and the pink ribbon movement in Kenya can be credited to the late Mary Onyango. Mary bravely led the breast movement for several years until she succumbed to the very disease she spent decades fighting.<\/p><p>October breast cancer month is marked with numerous activities. From wearing pink ribbons to discounted or free screening offers as well as cancer talk shows on radio and TV. Yet breast cancer cases continue to rise and survival is no better than it was 15 years ago when I joined the cancer advocacy movement.<\/p><p>Clearly, there is something fundamentally wrong with confining cancer to a four week once a year ritual. The greatest danger with this month-long cancer extravaganza is that it is rapidly taking the form and shape of Christmas: heavily commercialised and promptly forgotten until next year. Though we have not reached the North American levels of commercialising everything around breast cancer, there is a very gradual but relentless effort to merchandising of this serious disease. Breast cancer is now becoming a darling of the media and major corporates in Kenya using the pink ribbon to boost their image.<\/p><p>Reducing deaths from breast cancer will take more than pink ribbons and cancer talks. Creating &lsquo;awareness&rsquo; without accessible cancer treatment infrastructure is in itself myopic. Well-meaning community based organisations spend an incredible amount of time and resources spreading the cancer message in schools, churches and other social places. But without well-equipped referral channels to enable those with suspicious lumps or early stage disease get prompt diagnosis and treatment then these efforts will not contribute to reducing deaths.<\/p><p>A diagnosis of cancer brings unexpected confrontation with mortality. The fear, pain, emotional and financial distress are very real. Thus classifying patients as &lsquo;survivors&rsquo; and &lsquo;warriors&rsquo; sometimes gives an unfair insinuation that those who die from cancer give up the fight too soon. The metaphor of &lsquo;fighting cancer&rsquo; or the &lsquo;war on cancer&rsquo; is somewhat misplaced compared to the &lsquo;war on terror&rsquo; or the &lsquo;war on drugs&rsquo;. It would be very simplistic to describe cancer cells as the only enemy in the war. Cancer cells are a product of nature from the same linage as normal cells.<\/p><p>The disease is thus much more complex. Unlike drug lords and terrorists, cancer is not exactly malicious. Sometimes cancer just happens even to people with no known risk factors affecting the poor and the rich, the educated and the illiterate alike, no one actively seeks to get cancer save for tobacco users. Broader policy and legislative issues around cancer that must be part of the &lsquo;cancer war&rsquo; include funding of local research and enforcement of laws to reduce environmental carcinogens. There is a strong case for law to ban adverts of unhealthy foods along with a permanent ban on growing, processing and using tobacco and its products.<\/p><p>A pink ribbon means nothing to a breast cancer patient who cannot even raise bus fare to a treatment centre. The economically marginalised suffer disproportionately more and are more likely to die even with a diagnosis of early breast cancer. <\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><em>The writer is chairman of the Kenya Network of Cancer Organisations and manages the cancer programme at the Aga Khan University Hospital.<\/em><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Breast Cancer Detection <\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Breast Self-Exam<\/strong><\/p><p>Self-exams are a proactive way to help take care of yourself.

This period is crucial because the nutritional status of\nboth the mother and the child affects the child&rsquo;s mental and\nphysical growth and development. The behavior of the people\nsurrounding a child during this period, especially the mother, has\nmore influence on the development and health of the child than any\nother factor.<\/span><\/p><p align=\"JUSTIFY\">During pregnancy, both micro and macro nutrients needs for a mother\nincrease. It is of paramount importance that she consumes a healthy\ndiet to maintain her and her growing child&rsquo;s health. A pregnant\nwoman should consume 2200-2900 calories per day, increasing their\nintake gradually as the pregnancy progresses.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Consumption\nof a variety of foods from various food groups in pregnancy is\nimportant in order to meet all nutrient requirements. The extra\ncaloric requirements can be achieved through eating small, healthy\nsnacks in between main meals. Once pregnant, many women are tempted\nto &lsquo;eat for two&rsquo;; but in fact, there is no need to eat any extra\nfood especially for the first&nbsp; six months. Women who gain too much\nweight, those overweight or obese, could face increased complications\nwith the birth while their children will be faced with the increased\nrisk of health problems like obesity and diabetes later.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Lifestyle\nhabits like alcohol intake, smoking and drug abuse can alter the\nbody&rsquo;s metabolism limiting the extent to which the body can absorb\nand utilize nutrients. This increases the risk of under nutrition\nduring pregnancy. Alcohol is associated with a range of health\nproblems. When a pregnant woman consumes alcohol, it enters the fetal\nbloodstream in approximately the same concentration as in the\nmother&rsquo;s blood stream. Heavy drinking through the pregnancy can\nresult to fetal alcohol syndrome which produces infants that are\nunderweight, mentally deficient and at the risk of multiple\ndeformities. \n<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">World\nHealth Organisation recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months\nfor optimal health, growth and development. In Kenya, even though\nthere has been a great improvement in breastfeeding, only 61 per cent of\nchildren under six months of age are exclusively breastfed. This\nbeing higher during the 1<sup>st<\/sup> month and decreases in\nsubsequent months. Supplementation of breast milk or introduction of\nother liquids and solids starts early at around 4-5 months. (KDHS\n2009, 2014)<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Introduction\nof solids and other liquids is recommended after six months since by\nthen breast milk alone is no longer sufficient to maintain a child&rsquo;s\noptimal growth. During this transition period, the prevalence of\nmalnutrition increases significantly due poor feeding practices and\nincreased infections. In Kenya, there is this peculiar habit of\nparents feeding their children on the same foods day in day out until\nthey are ready to join in the family diet.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">This\nstandard menu comprising of boiled potatoes, pumpkins, banana and\nspinach is a good starts but lacks essential nutrients as the baby\ngrows. This standard diet that is loaded with carbohydrates and\ndeficient in other essential nutrients leads to malnutrition\nincluding an obese child with micronutrient deficiencies. According\nto KDHS 2008- 2009, only 39 per cent of all children age 6-23 months are fed\nin accordance with all infant and young child nutrition recommended\npractices, and only 54 per cent are fed from the requisite number of food\ngroups. Nationally, about, 26 per cent of Kenyan children are stunted, 4 per cent\nare wasted and 11 per cent are underweight. Lack of nutritional knowledge\nrather than food unavailability is main reason responsible for\nnutrition inadequacy among the under 5 in Kenya.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">These\npoor dietary practices lead to various forms of malnutrition: Under\nnutrition; an outcome of insufficient food intake; over nutrition,\nresulting from consumption of excess nutrients than what is required\nfor good health, growth and development, and micro nutrient\ndeficiencies, a  type of under nutrition where the body lacks in one\nor many micro nutrients. Slow behavioral development and mental\nretardation are seen especially in children with chronic\nmalnutrition. Even after recovery from malnutrition, a child may be\nleft with long-term effects like impairment in intellectual function\nand digestive problems which can be carried on for the rest of their\nlives. Overweight and obesity can lead to a number of health\ncomplications which may include hypertension, type 2 diabetes, sleep\ndisorders and cardiovascular diseases.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">&nbsp;Children\nlearn through observation. Parents are the greatest role models at\nthis age. For children below two years, teaching them to eat healthy\ncalls for more than just giving them what to eat. If you are picky\neater, if you leave your vegetable servings on the plate after meals;\nyou will most likely see the same habit with your child. If you want\nyour child to adopt healthy dietary habits, you must also observe\nthese habits.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Young\nminds are more receptive to new information and therefore knowledge\nand skills learnt in early childhood are more likely to be retained\nand practiced in the future. At this age, the children are at an\nexploratory stage, an opportunity that can be taken advantage of to\nimplant positive behavior. Habits and attitudes formed in early life\nare translated into the future adults&rsquo; lifestyles. \n<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It\nis hard to change the dietary habits of older children especially\nthose above 5 years. It is even harder to change that of an adult.\nLifestyle illnesses, also known as non communicable diseases are on\nthe rise in Kenya.If we\ntake care of our children in their first 1000 days, we will greatly\nreduce their risk of non-communicable illnesses in both childhood and\nadulthood.

Here, nerve paths split off and go in different directions, some to the pelvic area. The muscles in the pelvic floor, urethral and anal sphincter and bladder muscles are controlled by the brain through nerves that run from the sacral area. Sensations such as fullness in the bladder, or rectum are also relayed to the brain via these nerve routes.<\/p><p>Dr Thikra Sharif, the head of the pain management unit at the hospital, explained: &ldquo;Sacral nerve stimulator is a reversible treatment for patients with bladder and bowel control difficulties, chronic pelvic pain problems and who have had conservative treatments which have not worked.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Majority of these patients are unable to know when urine or stool comes out and often use diapers. This affects them psychologically and are very embarrassed to talk about the problem. With the new sacral nerve stimulator treatment, most of them will be able to go about their daily activities without any difficulties and need for assistance.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;This procedure is carried using a small device (a neurotransmitter) that is implanted under the skin in the upper buttock area. The device sends mild electrical impulses through a lead that is positioned close to a nerve located in the lower back (the sacral nerve) which influences the bladder, the anal sphincter and the pelvic floor muscles.&rdquo;<\/p><p>He said by stimulating the sacral nerve, a signal that manipulates a contraction within the pelvic floor is sent.

Vilembwa says a healthy mother is capable of producing up to 1.5 litres of milk a day, and can express most of this, especially in the first three months when the milk is plenty and the baby feeds on very little. The best time to express milk is at night. The milk should be frozen to create a milk bank, she says.<\/p><p> Vilembwa adds that infants should not be given anything else, not even water, before they are six months old. &ldquo;The mother&rsquo;s milk has everything the baby needs, including for quenching the baby&rsquo;s thirst,&rdquo; she says.<\/p><p> This is supported by nutrition expert Grace Gitau&rsquo;s sentiments that breastfeeding, especially early and exclusive breastfeeding, &ldquo;is one of the most significant ways to improve infant survival rates&rdquo;.<\/p><p> Gitau also supports HIV-infected mothers breastfeeding their babies, saying: &ldquo;Evidence on HIV and infant feeding shows that giving ARVs to HIV-infected mothers can significantly reduce the risk of transmission through breastfeeding and also improve her health.&rdquo; She says this enables infants of HIV-infected mothers to be breastfed with a low risk of transmission (1-2 per cent). Gitau says, however, breastfeeding should only stop once &ldquo;a nutritionally adequate and safe diet without breast milk can be provided&rdquo;.<\/p><p> The World Health Organisation says health authorities should endorse either breastfeeding while receiving ARVs for the mother or infant, or avoid breastfeeding at all. If mothers opt to breastfeed, they should only stop after the child&rsquo;s first birthday. Earlier, mothers with HIV were to breastfeed for six months then decide whether to stop or continue breastfeeding. But WHO now insists that if the mother chooses to breastfeed, she should only stop after 12 months.<\/p><p> The mother&rsquo;s milk has a rich array of nutrients and is balanced, keeping the baby healthy and strong. Besides nutrients, the milk contains anti-bodies that prevent the baby from getting infections and also fights germs and other foreign elements in the baby. The milk comes in two forms, the fore milk is a watery form that quenches the baby&rsquo;s thirst, and the later milk is thick and contains fats and most nutrients, Vilembwa says.<\/p><p> She further says that in case a baby needs supplements or medicine for an illness, the mother will be advised on what to give at the hospital. Otherwise, she should ensure her baby feeds only on breast milk for the first six months.<\/p><p> However, for HIV positive mothers, there is a lot more to do than just breastfeeding. They also need to keep healthy and follow guidelines to reduce chances of transmission of the virus to the baby and still keep the baby healthy and well-nourished. Vilembwa insists that for HIV positive mothers, the ministry&rsquo;s guidelines on feeding should be followed to ensure proper care for both mother and baby.<\/p><p> HIV-positive mothers are advised on the challenges and benefits of different feeding options &ndash; exclusive breastfeeding with antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) and exclusive replacement feeding &ndash; so they can make an informed decision on how to feed their babies, according to the Health ministry&rsquo;s Guidelines for Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV\/Aids in Kenya, 2012.<\/p><p> The ministry and WHO guidelines 2010 say that if the mother chooses to breastfeed, she will do so exclusively for the first six months, just like HIV-negative mothers, and breastfeed up to one year with appropriate complimentary feeds. She should only stop breastfeeding after 12 months.<\/p><p> But the babies should be provided with nevirapine prophylaxis for up to one week after the complete cessation of breastfeeding, according to the ministry guidelines. The ministry says the use of ARVs for the mother and child reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to child.<\/p><p>WHO says countries should implement guidelines on breastfeeding according to factors such as &ldquo;HIV prevalence, background infant and child mortality rates, current infant and young child feeding practices ad nutritional status of infants, availability of clean water and sanitation, socio-economic status of the population and quality of health services, including provision of interventions for PMTCT&rdquo;.<\/p><p> In some countries, especially those with low infant and mortality rates, replacement feeding may remain the best strategy to promote HIV-free survival among HIV-exposed infants, according to WHO.<\/p><p> Gitau says those who do not have access to ARVs should be counselled to exclusively breastfeed for six months and continue breastfeeding thereafter or give the children infant formula if the environmental and social circumstances are safe for, and supportive of, feeding with formula.<\/p>","newsitem_id":"1207526","section_id":"24","sorted_tags":["Breastfeeding","Breast milk","Baby bottle","Infant","Milk","Infant","Lactation","Human"],"theme":{"Breastfeeding":"0.972698","Breast milk":"0.771506","Baby bottle":"0.65149","Infant":"0.634818","Milk":"0.552106","Infant formula":"0.53643","Lactation":"0.517388","Human milk banking in North America":"0.484745"}}},{"node":{"nid":"2106","type":"article","title":"Cancer survivor gets new lease of life","byline":"BY WILLIAM MWANGI","date":"2015-09-28 02:30:00","image":"http:\/\/www.the-star.co.ke\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/mobile_app\/public\/articles\/2015\/09\/28\/1194365.jpg?itok=VPpmCtJo|ALT|Joyce Wawira, a cancer survirvor.Photo\/Faraja","body":"<p>Joyce Wawira, 35, a mother of two, discovered she had breast cancer last year.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Initially, I had a small lump on her right breast. After a visit to a doctor, a sample from the lump was taken for further tests. The tests came out and I was given a clean bill of health,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>However, early last year, Wawira realised that the lump would enlarge every time she had her menses.<\/p><p>Worsening the situation, blood was oozing from her nipple.<\/p><p>&ldquo;A biopsy at Aga Khan University Hospital confirmed the tumor was indeed breast cancer which, luckily, was in its early stage,&rdquo; Wawira added.<\/p><p>Her workmates assisted her in raising funds for an insurance cover that would cater for her medical expenses. &ldquo;My colleagues were really helpful and they raised funds for my first chemo but after that I had no funds to continue with the sessions which made me seek other solutions,&rdquo; he said.<\/p><p>Wawira sought help from Nairobi-based Faraja Cancer Support Trust and they promised to assess her case. Faraja and Nakumatt decided to fund Wawira&rsquo;s chemotherapy sessions with funds they had raised in a campaign dubbed,  &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s fight this battle together&rsquo; in October last year.<\/p><p>The funds raised through this campaign were used to offer free breast, cervical and prostate cancer screening. The deficit remaining from the campaign will be used to treat cancer patients like Wawira.<\/p><p>After undergoing the chemotherapy for over six months, Wawira got well and decided to go for a final test to ensure that she was well.<\/p><p>&ldquo;On going for final tests, I got the shocker news that my right side was fully recovered but my left breast had a swelling,&rdquo; Wawira added.<\/p><p>Wawira says she was devastated and even quit her job because she could not raise money but Faraja asked her to go for more tests.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Faraja agreed to do more tests that I am still going through and I am praying this time it is not cancerous, i still do not know how to thank the Nakumatt and Faraja for their support in my cancer journey,&rdquo; she said. She is among the many cancer cases that are reported across the globe with numbers growing.<\/p><p>In Kenya about about 40,000 cancer cases are reported annually.<\/p>","newsitem_id":"1194362","section_id":"24","sorted_tags":["Cancer","Breast cancer","Oncology","Metastasis","Chemotherapy","Estrogen","Breast cancer","Screening"],"theme":{"Cancer":"0.987152","Breast cancer":"0.900895","Oncology":"0.655971","Metastasis":"0.633744","Chemotherapy":"0.536218","Estrogen":"0.535987","Breast":"0.46284","Screening":"0.441958"}}}],"tags":{"Food":2,"Epidemiology":3,"John Snow":1,"Hygiene":2,"James K.
