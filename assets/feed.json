But she did have a point, women smoking was not  something one could easily observe in developing countries such as  Kenya, not until recent times.\n The situation was different in  developed countries where a woman smoking is nothing to write home  about and is a rising trend. Subsequently,  cases of lung cancer in women is higher in developing  countries.\nHowever,  what came as a surprise was the finding that lung cancer is now the  leading cause of death in women in developed countries. According to  the report by the American Cancer Society in collaboration with the  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) released on the  recently celebrated World Cancer Day, lung cancer has surpassed  breast cancer, with the change reflecting the rising tobacco uptake in  women.\nIn  2012, lung cancer was the most  commonly diagnosed cancer, with 1.8 million cases worldwide,  accounting for 13 per cent of all cancer cases. Whereas approximately 70 per cent of  the world\u2019s lung cancer burden can be attributed to smoking alone,  second-hand smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke, has  also been proven to cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults.\nCancer  now constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less  developed countries alike, and its occurrence is increasing because  of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing  prevalence of risk factors associated with economic growth and  urbanisation, such as smoking, being overweight, physical inactivity,  and changing reproductive patterns.\n  In  less developed countries, lung and breast cancer are the most  frequently diagnosed cancers and the leading causes of cancer death  in men and women, respectively. In more developed countries, prostate  and breast cancer are the most frequently diagnosed cancers among men  and women, respectively, and lung cancer is the leading cause of  cancer death in both men and women. Colorectal cancer has become a  frequent cause of cancer death not only in developed countries, but  also in developing countries.\u00a0\n  The  researchers point out that breast, lung, and colorectal cancers are  increasing in many countries in economic transition with an already  disproportionately high burden of cancers related to infection,  including cancers of the liver, stomach and cervix.\n  The  worrying finding in the report indicates the already established  relation between human behaviour such as cigarette smoking in this  case and the increase in malignancies.\n  The  report further state that a number of cancers that were once rare in  developing countries are becoming increasingly common as those  countries adopt a more Western lifestyle. \u201cA coordinated and  intensified response from all sectors of society, including  governments, civil society, the private sector, and individuals, is  required to seize control of the growing burden of cancer,\u201d they  conclude.\n  I  couldn't help but remember my grandmother's remark and how in an  effort to appear 'developed', we might be losing sight of the fact  that not everything we adopt is beneficial. How long before, we start  mirroring similar findings in Kenya?   \n  It  remains that a substantial proportion of the worldwide burden of  cancer can be prevented through the application of existing cancer  control knowledge, including tobacco control, vaccination (for  example in cervical cancer), early detection, and the promotion of  physical activity and healthy dietary patterns.\n  But  as my grandmother put it, \"Our behaviour does define us.\"...even  in health.\n  \n\u00a0\nCANCER  KEY FACTS   \n\n   Cancers figure   among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with   approximately 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer related   deaths in 2012.\n\n\n   The number of   new cases is expected to rise by about 70% over the next 2 decades.\n\n\n   Among men, the five most common sites of cancer diagnosed in 2012 were lung, prostate,   colorectum, stomach, and liver cancer.\n\n\n   Among women   the 5 most common sites diagnosed were breast, colorectum, lung,   cervix, and stomach cancer.\n\n\n   Around one   third of cancer deaths are due to the 5 leading behavioural and   dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake,   lack of physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol use.\n\n\n   Tobacco use is   the most important risk factor for cancer causing around 20% of   global cancer deaths and around 70% of global lung cancer deaths.\n\n\n   More than 60%   of world\u2019s total new annual cases occur in Africa, Asia and   Central and South America. These regions account for 70% of the   world\u2019s cancer deaths.\n\n  World Health  Organisation\n\n\n","field_image":[{"src":"http://www.the-star.co.ke/sites/default/files/images/articles/2015/03/09/22555/12.png","alt":"Healthy women shave hair in solidarity with the cancer patients who lose their hair after chemotherapy in 2012.

The country pays only Sh80 million and the balance is cleared by Gavi Alliance, a donor consortium who are also funding the five-year study.\n\u00a0The study proves the Gavi and Kenya are spending their money effectively.\n\u00a0\u201cThe cost-effectiveness of the vaccine program will be calculated based on the costs of vaccine introduction, the costs of treatment averted, and the changes in incidence observed,\u201d said Kemri-Wellcome Trust in its report.\n\u00a0Pneumonia is currently the biggest killer of Kenyan children under five years.\n\u00a0The survey compares the incidence rates of invasive pneumococcal disease, radiologically proven pneumonia, and all-cause admissions to hospital in the period before vaccine introduction and the period after vaccine introduction.\n\u00a0It also assesses the safety of the vaccine at four sites.

He said the disease is more prevalent in areas where locals have poor hygiene, especially areas with a lot of cow dung, which attracts flies that spread the disease from one person to another.\n \u201cIn some areas inhabited by the Maasai community, it is considered as chasing away wealth if you get rid of flies from your face. That is why when you go to many places you will find women and children seated comfortably with a swam of flies around them,\u201d said Dr Lumarai.\nHe says the signs of the disease are eye lashes rubbing on cornea and corneal scar, scar tarsal plate, red eyes, stretchy discharge, flies on the face and that  the victims tend to be uncomfortable with light.\nWorld Health Organisation explains that if left untreated, trachoma infection eventually causes the eyelid to turn inwards, which in turn causes the eyelashes to rub on the eyeball, resulting in intense pain and scarring of the front of the eye. This ultimately leads to irreversible blindness, typically from age 30-40.\n\u201cWomen are blinded two to three times more often than men, probably due to their close contact with affected children,\u201d says the 2014 WHO trachoma fact sheet.\nIt adds that infection spreads through personal contact like hands and clothing, and by flies that have been in contact with discharge from the eyes and nose of infected persons.\n\u201cOverall, Africa remains the most affected continent and the one with the most intensive control efforts. In 2012, 47 million people were treated with antibiotics and 169 000 cases of trichiasis were operated in 29 endemic countries of WHO\u2019s Africa Region,\u201d it says.\nDr Lumarai adds that the maintenance of good hygiene is the best way to stop the disease and is better than treatment.\n\u201cProper disposal of waste to avoid breeding of flies, proper disposal of human faeces in pit latrines, not sharing of towels and handkerchiefs, always washing your face with clean water and also not sharing of living space with animals will go along way in bringing trachoma to an end in Trans Mara,\u201d he says.\nIn 2011, baseline surveys found that seven out of the 18 counties suspected trachoma endemic counties were most affected. These are Kajiado, Narok, Baringo, Laikipia, Samburu, Meru and West Pokot.\nSeven counties were found to have communities with both infectious and blinding trachoma.\nKenya has an eight-year National Trachoma plan from 2008-2015 to end the disease completely. \nThe ministry of health is expected to belatedly spearhead the implementation of the plan.\n\u201cAbout seven million Kenyans live in 18 suspected trachoma endemic counties, which have challenges of perennial water shortages, dry and dusty environment, inadequate sanitation, poor hygiene and  high poverty levels,\u201d says Dr Lumarai.\n  The implementation is expected to be done through the implementation of WHO\u2019s recommended SAFE strategy which targets all key elements necessary for long and short- term intervention programme.\nSAFE stands for Surgery for trichiasis (potentially blinding trachoma).\nControl programmes in endemic countries are being implemented through the WHO recommended SAFE strategy. \nPREVENTING THE DISEASEThis consists of:Surgery to treat the blinding stage of the disease\u00a0Antibiotics to treat infection from the trachoma bacteriaFacial cleanliness, to educate the at risk population on the preventive measures; andenvironmental improvements, such as providing access to safe water and improved sanitation.Data reported to WHO by Member States in 2012 shows that about 47 million people in endemic communities were treated with antibiotics to eliminate trachoma.Elimination efforts need to continue to satisfy the target set by the World Health Assembly resolution to end trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.\n\u00a0\n","field_image":[{"src":"http://www.the-star.co.ke/sites/default/files/images/articles/2015/03/02/21437/12_1.png","alt":"David Lekuye, an Ophtamologist at the Trans Mara Level Four Hospital carrying out a checkup on patients who had undergone an operation to remove cataracts and treat Trachoma"},{"src":"http://www.the-star.co.ke/sites/default/files/images/articles/2015/03/02/21437/12_2.png","alt":"Trachoma patients at the Trans Mara Level Four Hospital"}],"nid":"21437","path":"/article/healthy-villagers-put-drugs-stop-trachoma","created":"Monday, March 2, 2015 - 09:30","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"You're killing people, tobacco firms told","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"BY GILBERT KOECH","body":"THE World Health Organisation has put cigarette makers on the spot for flouting anti-tobacco laws like the ban on advertising.\nLast week, health officials from Africa met in Nairobi to mark 10 years of the WHO\u2019s framework convention on tobacco control (FCTC).\nWHO\u2019s regional director for Africa Dr Matshidiso Moeti, in a speech read on her behalf by WHO\u2019s country director, Dr Custodia Mandlhate, said the industry continues to package and market tobacco products in a very attractive manner despite evidence proving that it has no known health benefits, but it instead causes diseases and premature deaths.\nThe FCTC is the first international anti-tobacco treaty and Kenya was second to sign it.\nMoeti said countries cannot continue to witness passive tobacco users losing lives prematurely.\n\u201cPublic health should always have priority over any trade and economic interests because it is health that generates wealth,\u201d she said.\nMoeti described tobacco epidemic as one of the biggest threats the world has ever faced, killing nearly six million people yearly.\nAccording to WHO, nearly 80 per cent of of the more than a billion smokers worldwide live in low and middle-income countries where tobacco-related illnesses and deaths are heaviest.\nThe global adult tobacco survey indicates that 19.1 per cent of men and 4.5 per cent of women currently use tobacco in Kenya.\nOverall, 41.3 per cent of current smokers started using tobacco aged 20-24 while 32.3 per cent started at age 17-19.\nMoeti said tobacco control has been recognised as a priority area for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases.\nHealth ministry estimates that non-communicable diseases contribute nearly 50 per cent of all admissions in public hospitals in Kenya.\nShe urged governments to renew political commitment to the convention and allocate adequate resources for implementation to help help tame the \u201cpowerful opponent\u201d.\nHealth CS James Macharia said Africa has become the main target for tobacco industry.\n\u201cOur very own Tobacco Control Act was enacted in 2007.

I don't blame you because the truth of the matter is  that the intense health awareness campaigns and funding tuberculosis receives keeps it in the news. In a day, you are bound to either receive a  newsletter touching on TB or  see a public service announcement on TV  relating to the disease.\nHowever,  the infectious disease that causes the greatest under-five mortality  is pneumonia. But most people are bound to forget the statistics as  it does not receive as much attention as other diseases such as tuberculosis or HIV and Aids. And certainly, it is not an epidemic  that can cause such panic as Ebola did recently.\n  A report released for World Pneumonia Day in November  last year by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)  found that international development assistance  targeting pneumonia represents a very small portion of overall global  health financing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0According to  the report, Pushing the Pace: Progress and Challenges in Fighting  Childhood Pneumonia found that just two percent ($US670 million) of  the estimated $US30.6 billion of international development assistance  for health was spent on fighting pneumonia in 2011.\n\u00a0This is despite  the fact that pneumonia claimed 905,059 children\u2019s lives in 2013,  or 14 per cent of all under five deaths.\n\u00a0Furthermore,  the report found that reductions in child pneumonia deaths since 1990  (58 per cent) have not kept pace with other childhood killers, for example  measles (83%) and diarrhea (68 per cent).\u00a0   \n  Progress has  been particularly slow for high-burden countries in sub-Saharan  Africa where declines in total child pneumonia deaths averaged just  14 per cent.\u00a0 Nigeria only saw a 4 per cent decline in total child pneumonia  deaths and a number of countries, including Democratic Republic of  Congo, Chad, and Cameroon, actually experienced increases in child  lives lost to pneumonia. \u00a0\n  The fact that  many of the countries that have performed so poorly in reducing child  pneumonia deaths suggests that the level of investment  and disease prioritisation are critical factors, and also imply a  lack of integration in managing the major childhood killers in these  countries. \u00a0\n\u00a0In contrast,  countries like China, India, Iran, Bangladesh, Mozambique and  Indonesia have all recorded reductions in child pneumonia deaths  above 70 per cent since 1990, an indication that dramatic reductions in child  pneumonia deaths are possible.\u00a0\n  The report  finds that over 80 per cent of the estimated $US670 million of development  assistance for pneumonia in 2011 was invested in vaccine programmes,  while other areas of pneumonia prevention, diagnosis and treatment,  specifically breastfeeding, reducing indoor air pollution, improving  pneumonia diagnostic technologies and access to antibiotics and  oxygen therapy have not received the same levels of investment.\n\u00a0Speaking  at  the 45th Union World Conference on Lung Health, Stephen Graham, a  paediatrician  and Professor of International Child Health with University of  Melbourne with particular interest in Pneumonia said: \" It is a  sad fact that we continue to neglect pneumonia and don't give it as  much attention whether in terms of funding or prevention measures.  However, it still the leading infectious disease killer of children  under the age of five. This is a situation that we must remedy as the  statistics won't change unless we make the changes needed.\"\n  And part of  that change is increasing the amount of funding directed to  pneumonia. As more resources are required not only to increase access  to the vaccine, but in education of prevention measures such as  breastfeeding and cooking in hygienic conditions. In addition, the  appropriate diagnostic methods need to be available and applied  followed by prescription of the right antibiotic and treatment  including oxygen therapy.\n  Even more so,  as we know that seven out of every ten child pneumonia deaths now  occur in just 15 countries, new investments need to prioritize the  sub-populations of children in these countries, with a special focus  on sub-Saharan populations where child pneumonia deaths are actually  increasing.\n\u00a0\n\nPNEUMONIA FACTS IN KENYA\nSevere pneumonia is caused by a bacterial pathogen, streptococcus   pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza, which attack a child\u2019s lungs   leading to difficulty in breathing, cough, fever, chills, headaches,   loss of appetite and wheezing.\nKenyans children under two years are vaccined with pneumococcal vaccine to prevent pneumonia.\nThe disease kills 30,000 children each year, and many more are left with   permanent disabilities. \nKenyan children aged below five years are less likely to die from   pneumonia and diarrhoea than they were a decade ago, says the   World Bank.\nIt kills more children than any other disease \u2013 more than Aids, malaria and measles combined.\n\u00a0\n","field_image":{"src":"http://www.the-star.co.ke/sites/default/files/images/articles/2015/02/23/20557/12.png","alt":"PREVENTION: A child is vaccinated with a pneumococcal shot in Nakuru last year."},"nid":"20557","path":"/article/why-pneumonia-still-kills-thousands-children","created":"Monday, February 23, 2015 - 09:30","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"Nairobi Hospital buys latest heart-lung machine","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"BY WILLIAM MWANGI","body":"The Nairobi Hospital has commissioned a new Heart-Lung Machine, known as the Cardiopulmonary Bypass Machine (CBM).The hospital is the first in Kenya   to acquire the Sh30 million German equipment, which is the latest in its series, the   S5.\nThe   CBM temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs   during   surgery, maintaining the circulation of blood and the oxygen   content of   the body.\nDuring the launch, Nairobi Hospital CEO Dr   Cleopa Mailu said the hospital will now accommodate more patients for surgery.\n\"Technology   in Kenya is at par with global best in the fight against heart-lung   conditions with the Cardiopulmonary Bypass Machine (CBM) S5 series,\"   said Dr Mailu while commissioning the equipment that   was manufactured last month.   \nHe added: \u201cThe device will assist in providing quality service   and optimum care to patients while undergoing an open-heart surgery   locally, sparing Kenyans the hustle of travelling abroad to seek such   medical services.\n\u201cWe   must ensure that as one of the leading healthcare providers in the   region, we have requisite expertise and the best of equipment available   with current technology in the fight against heart and lung conditions,\u201d   he said.\n\u00a0The equipment is operated by a perfusionist, a   healthcare professional specifically trained to use the heart-lung   machine during cardiac surgery and other surgeries that require the use   of a CBM to manage the patient\u2019s physiological status.

This   includes  condoms being associated with immorality, promiscuity, prostitution and unfaithfulness. AHF, a non-governmental organisation involved in the fight against the spread of  HIV and Aids, offers free  HIV testing, treatment and care as well as counselling and condom promotion and distribution. She said recent studies in condom use promotion and distribution among   men and women between 15-24 years shows a 43 per cent consistent condom   use among men with their female partners of unknown  HIV status in the past 12 months and a 11 per cent consistent condom use among women with their female partners of unknown  HIV status in the last 12 months.\n\u00a0\nButter and whole\n milk not bad for you\nGuidelines that told millions of people to avoid butter and full-fat milk should never have been introduced, say experts.\nThe startling assertion challenges advice that has been followed by the medical profession for 30 years. The   experts say the advice from 1983, aimed at reducing deaths from heart   disease, lacked any solid trial evidence to back it up.\n\n\nA   new review says evidence from trials did not support the advice. It   says it is \u2018incomprehensible\u2019 that such advice was introduced for   56 million Britons in 1983 and 220 million Americans six years earlier \"given the contrary results from a small number of unhealthy men\".\nThe present review concludes that dietary advice not merely needs review; it should not have been introduced.\u2019\nHowever,   many public health and nutrition scientists criticised the conclusions   of the review in the online BMJ journal Open Heart, saying wider   evidence at the time and since has justified the advice and heart deaths   have fallen dramatically.\nThe   researchers carried out a review of data from trials that would have   been available to UK and US regulators at the time. Last year a US research   scientist called for a campaign telling people they had been taken down   the \u2018wrong dietary road for decades\u2019\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLiberia schools reopen\n after six-month closure\nStudents in Liberia returned to their classrooms after a   six-month closure during the Ebola epidemic that left thousands dead,   lining up in their uniforms to have their temperatures taken before they   could enter school gates. Pupils who trickled in to Saint Michael High   School on the outskirts of the capital also washed their hands with   chlorinated water before going inside. Many students said they had grown   tired of sitting at home, and at least one principal said teenage   pregnancy had spiked during the six-month school gap. A few, though,   remained a bit fearful about returning even though there are just a   handful of Ebola cases left in the country that once saw 100 new   patients a week.          \n\n\n          \n\n\nLiberia has seen the   highest death toll from the Ebola epidemic, with 3,800 killed. Deputy   Education Minister Remses Kumbuyah said more than 5,000 kits were   distributed to schools that included thermometers and chlorine for   hand-washing.\n","field_image":"","nid":"20560","path":"/article/week-11","created":"Monday, February 23, 2015 - 00:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"HEALTH DIARY","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"John Muchangi","body":"The World Zero   Discrimination Day will be marked next week on Monday.

She lost her right leg and has been on crutches since.\nShe had travelled to Nairobi to stay with her husband, who worked for the UNHCR, when she slipped in a bathroom injuring her right knee.\n\u201cI was taken to Kenyatta National Hospital where I was treated and discharged. But the knee problem persisted with a lot of pus flowing out and in 2005, my leg had to be amputated at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in Mumias,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThis became the turning point and most frustrating part of my life because I had to learn to use one leg and crutches. By then I had three children \u2013 two girls and one boy,\u201d Chibwire recalls.\nShe particularly found it difficult taking care of her daughter Jemimah Muruka, who was born with spina bifida - a permanently disabling birth defect where a baby\u2019s spinal column does not close all of the way.\n\u201cMy family now had two people with disability and later on I gave birth to a boy, John Murenga, who had a similar problem of spina bifida, and the number of disabled members of my family increased to three,\u201d she says.\nThe parents took Murenga to Kiambu District Hospital where he was fitted with a shunt to enable him move.\n\u201cBut it never worked and he was left to crawl down unable to stand up and walk on his own,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThe two have a problem of passing urine and stool without a break and we introduced them to use of diapers. But because I cannot afford money for constant purchase of the tissue, they developed bedsores, which have grown to chronic wounds.\u201d\nShe said some members of her family deserted her, \u201cbut my late husband remained strong with me and tirelessly supported his family as the breadwinner\u201d.\nJemimah completed Form four in 2013 - the same year her dad died - at Joyland Secondary School in Kisumu and attained a mean grade of C- (minus).\nShe practises singing and has compiled gospel songs which she is appealing for well-wishers to help her record.\n\u201cBesides producing music, I aspire to be a teacher for the physically handicapped lot so that I can help them acquire quality education,\u201d Jemimah, now 21, says.\nShe appeals to the government and the private sector to help create awareness about the importance of education and facilitate access to schools.\n\u201cIt is important to promote the concepts of inclusive education in the rural schools, which can help in promoting local nursery schools and ensuring that young children with impairments have access to these schools.\u201d\nMurenga is now in class six at Ngairwe Primary School in Matungu where he was transferred to from Lunganyiro Special School after his sponsor pulled out.\nHis legs are paralysed and filled with septic wounds because a sensory impairment has left him numb, and he doesn\u2019t feel when he is injured.\nHis mother says he sometimes unawares sits on fire. \u201cI am highly challenged by movement in school especially when my assisting devices break down. I am forced to crawl until I am picked by good Samaritans,\u201d Murenga says.\nChibwire, now 43 and mother of six children - three deceased- is the current chairperson of Matungu Disability Network Organisation and manages more than 77 groups in the district.\nShe says the network helps enhance the quality of life of disabled people by improving service delivery, providing more equitable opportunities and by promoting and protecting their human rights.\nThe groups have engaged in income-generating projects including poultry rearing, open-market businesses and cereal businesses, goat and rabbit rearing. But many of these projects collapse when funds run dry.\n\u201cWe got sponsorship from the Union of Disabled People of Kenya (UDPK) which enabled each group to get Sh30,000. They started development projects through a revolving fund,\u201d said Chibwire.\nThe 77 groups from Matungu are also benefiting from the government\u2019s cash transfer programme.\nChibwire says disabled people in villages require increased access to vocational and skills training. She wants the devolved governments to promote awareness and also devolve existing laws related to the employment of persons with disabilities.\n\u201cThe family of the disabled person is the most important resource. Its skills and knowledge should be promoted by adequate training and supervision, using a technology closely related to local experience,\u201d she says.\n\u00a0\nRIGHTS FOR KENYANS WITH DISABILITY\nKenya has adopted a number of laws and policies pertaining to people with disabilities, including their right to productive and decent work and basic services.

Extended families and communities were providing care for the vast majority of the children with only three percent of them needing to be placed outside family or community care. Children who had been exposed to Ebola were being kept under a 21-day observation period - the maximum incubation period of the virus - and provided with support by a network of survivors. \nEbola survivors are able to interact with the children during the monitoring period because they have developed a level of resistance to the virus, UNICEF said.\n\u00a0\nUS to withdraw army from the Ebola zone\nThe United States is preparing to withdraw nearly all of its troops fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the White House said, as the global health crisis recedes amid a sharp decline in Ebola cases.

The first phase was launched in Samburu, Mwingi and Kibera with 319 community health workers and volunteers.\n\u201cAt least 3,000 community health workers are set to benefit from the launch of the second phase of the mobile training platform,\" says Lennie Bazira, acting CEO for Amref Health Africa, who manage the service.\nAmref says the Health Enablement and Learning Platform (Help) is similar to WhatsApp, and allows the volunteers to interact with each other in deliberating on a diagnosis.\nThe project equips the volunteer health volunteers (CHV) with skills to administer first aid to patients before they get to a health facility, thus averting needless deaths.\n\u201cWe are leveraging on mobile technology to offer training that is assigned to the Ministry of Health,\" Dr Bazira says.\nM-pesa Foundation executive director Les Baillie says training of community health workers and volunteers is critical in delivery of quality health services. \u201cWe should move away from viewing community health workers as an alternative and instead have then as an integral part of the state's responsibility for health care delivery. This is the strategy the Brazilian government adopted and has worked amazingly,\u201d Baillie says.\nThe M-pesa foundation has injected Sh138 million into the second phase of the programme. The M-Pesa Foundation was registered as a Charitable Trust in 2010 and invests in large-scale projects mainly in education, health and environment.\nThrough Help, community health workers can access training material via a basic mobile phone, not necessarily a smart phone, and listen to a pre-recorded training session. This eases their work and also helps community members who are away from health facilities.\nAccenture managing director Louise James was present at last week's launch at Michael Joseph Centre at Safaricom headquarters.\nShe said the programme was key in merging mobile technology and health care. \u201cWe recognise that merging mobile technology with health training systems offers opportunities for increased reach and scale, providing an effective channel for personalised, flexible learning for community health workers and widespread improvement in the provision of health care throughout Kenya and beyond,\u201d she said.\nAccording to several reviews, Help is more effective in areas with inadequate health workers, where people lack health facilities, regions with high poverty and also where there are cultural barriers.\nIt has particularly been successful in Samburu. \u201cWe have seen growth in the number of women giving birth in hospitals with a very high percentage. Infant mortality has also decreased as our region had one of the highest in the country due to lack of infrastructure in the county,\u201d says Moses Lenolkulal, Governor for Samburu County, who was also present during the launch.\nTo enhance the service provision in the county, a community unit in Barsolai was set. It comprises more than 70 community health volunteers and supervisors, who were trained using the platform.\nIt uses the curriculum from the Ministry of Health to community health workers on how to provide mostly maternal services.\nThey track expectant mothers throughout their pregnancy and provide them with counselling and also teach them on immunisation and care for their children.\nThe software can also be designed in English or Swahili. Accenture Foundation and Safaricom funded phase one of the project at USD 1.7 million and Sh600,000 respectively.\nThe funds were to build, test and debut the project for 12 months.\nIn a past interview Naomi Wanja, one mother who had a miscarriage, says the CHV assigned to her advised her to immediately visit a hospital when the baby stopped kicking. \u201cShe advised me to visit the Amref clinic in Kibera, and after scanning I was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital. At Kenyatta I was referred to St Mary\u2019s where they confirmed my baby was dead. I returned to Kenyatta where I underwent surgery to remove the foetus.\u201d\nAnother beneficiary, Ann Kemunto, who was in her third pregnancy, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine I would be helped this much, like now, if I experience any pain, I\u2019m able to call my CHV Lona Bonyo. She straight away tells me what to do. She also she has advised me on other issues like the upbringing of my child and financial planning of my pregnancy before and after.\u201d\nWycliffe Ogeya, the head community health extension worker in Kibera, earlier named most challenges as social. Kibera residents would rather visit ritual prayers, traditional healers and birth attendants in far rural areas than the nearest health facilities, he said. \u201cThe health facilities were underused despite the free health services provided here. \u2018Help\u2019 stepped in to address the stated challenges by advocating for the use of personal phones to cater health needs.\u201d\n","field_image":[{"src":"http://www.the-star.co.ke/sites/default/files/images/articles/2015/02/09/1793/12_1.png","alt":"ALL IS WELL: Nurse Ann Warui chats with an expectant mother.

While smoking rates in Africa remain low compared to other continents and regions, they are rising rapidly, particularly among the young.\nAccording to recent research, there has been a 71 percent increase in the number of African teenagers who have tried smoking since 2008.\nHere in Kenya, the World Health Organisation has found that fifteen percent of Kenyans aged between 13 and 15 use tobacco.\nIt explains why, although the prevalence of smoking among adult Africans remains the lowest in the world, it is now higher among boys and girls than in any other developing regions. In some African countries, child smokers now outnumber adult smokers.\nThis shocking rise is storing up huge problems for Africa.\nSmoking is already the number one known cause of cancer on the continent, killing more people every day.\nUnless we tackle tobacco consumption among young Africans now, estimates suggest that the number of smokers on the continent will rise seven-fold by the end of the century.\nThe future cost \u2013 in human lives, healthcare costs and lost economic opportunities \u2013 will be vast and will be a huge brake on our continent\u2019s ambitions for the future.\nBut how do we go about reversing this worrying trend, stopping young Africans from becoming smokers? In Botswana, we have been pioneering a new approach \u2013 the SKY project - to inspire teenage girls to make the positive choice for themselves to turn their backs on smoking before they even start.\nFrom the outset, the project took a fundamentally different approach to previous anti-smoking campaigns aimed at young people in Botswana by focusing on prevention, rather than trying to convince current young smokers to stop.\nDrawing on insights from social marketing and behaviour change, we decided that the project should start with the person not the issue.\nWe also realised that, like young people all over the world, young people in Botswana don\u2019t like being told what to do but want to find the right path for themselves.\nWe also discovered that while most of Botswana\u2019s girls said they didn\u2019t want to start smoking, many felt under pressure to try.\nWe realised that they are more likely to listen to their friends than adults, no matter how well-meaning.\nSo we set out to create a campaign and movement which would allow teenage girls to provide encouragement to each other to resist temptations to smoke.\nWhen girls sign up to the project, they are only asked to take a pledge to be true to themselves.\nThis includes being encouraged to say no to the things that they know they are good without, including smoking.\nFor SKY project to succeed we knew that it would be critical to work within the social world of teenage girls \u2013 engaging with the topics, people, places and channels that make up the fabric of their daily lives \u2013 and to put the girls themselves in charge of creating the content.\nThe project is off to a successful start.

The virus is even more deadly to great apes that it is for   humans, with mortality rates as high as 95 per cent for gorillas and 77 per cent for   chimpanzees. That compares to around 50 per cent for humans. The outbreaks   are infrequent, but when they strike they can wipe out huge swathes of   the animals, especially if the carcasses are left uncollected.\nThe claim is made by Meera Inglis, a conservation policy professor at University of Sheffield, in her article on The Conversation website.\nShe says Ebola has been responsible for several catastrophe great ape population declines.In   1995, an outbreak killed off 90 per cent of gorillas in a national park in   Gabon. In 2002-2003 another outbreak killed 5,000 gorillas in the   Democratic Republic of Congo. With an estimated 100,000 gorillas left in the wild, that's a major blow. Africa's great apes are also under attack from poaching, habitat destruction, war and other infectious diseases. The lack of habitat means that infected animals are more likely to   come into contact with each other, and therefore more likely to contract   the virus; it\u2019s a vicious cycle. As a consequence both eastern gorillas and western gorillas have been listed as endangered since 2008. The   spread of the deadly virus could be curbed by vaccinating the animals -   a safe and effective vaccine for gorillas and apes has already been   developed - unlike for humans. However, the trials of the vaccines haven\u2019t yet involved testing vaccinated chimps with the live virus.\n\u00a0\nOutbreak in West Africa\n slowing down says UN\nAn outbreak of  Ebola   that has claimed more than 8,400 lives in West Africa appears to be   slowing down, though the battle to contain the disease is not over, the   UN special envoy on  Ebola said. The hemorrhagic fever is spread through contact with bodily fluids of   infected people or the highly contagious body of someone who has died   of the virus. Nabarro said burial practices that involved people   touching and cleaning bodies of  Ebola victims had helped fuel the outbreak. The worst  Ebola   outbreak on record infected about 21,200 people in Liberia, Sierra   Leone and Guinea since it was detected in March, according to the World   Health Organization. The government of Liberia said earlier on that it could be free   of the virus by the end of next month after success in curbing   transmission. It said the country had only 10 confirmed  Ebola cases as of Jan. 12. More than 3,500 of the 8,400 dead were from Liberia. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea now have capacity to quickly set up mobile centers to handle localized outbreaks.\n\u00a0\nWHO releases papers on\n outbreak after one year\n\u00a0\nOne year after the first Ebola cases started to surface in Guinea, WHO   is publishing this series of 14 papers that take an in-depth look at   West Africa\u2019s first epidemic of Ebola virus disease. This assessment looks at how West Africa\u2019s epidemic of Ebola virus   disease has evolved over the past year, giving special attention to the   situation in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The success stories in   Senegal, Nigeria, and likely Mali are also described to show what has   worked best to limit onward transmission of Ebola following an imported   case and bring the outbreak to a rapid end. The fact that a densely   populated city like Lagos was successful in containing Ebola offers   encouragement that other developing countries can do the same. An overview of how the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of   Congo evolved and was brought under control underscores the many   differences between the outbreaks in West Africa and in equatorial   Africa, where all previous outbreaks since the first two in 1976 have   occurred. Key events in the WHO response are outlined to show how   initial control efforts were eventually overwhelmed by the wide   geographical dispersion of transmission, the unprecedented operational   complexity of the outbreaks, and the many factors that undermined the   power of traditional containment measures to disrupt transmission   chains.\n","field_image":"","nid":"5056","path":"/article/ebola-watch","created":"Monday, January 26, 2015 - 00:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"HEALTH DIARY","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"John Muchangi","body":"Hosted   by the German government in Berlin, the Gavi Vaccine Alliance will tomorrow hold a   meeting to mobilise funds for global immunisation programmes for 2016-   2020.

But researchers in the US are now predicting, in the journal PLOS Biology, that the epidemic in Liberia, which at one point had the biggest explosion in Ebola cases, could peter out by June 2015. \nIn coming up with their predictive models, the researchers, led by John Drake University of Georgia, took into account data from previous outbreaks of Ebola, as well as probabilities about infection rates among healthcare workers, family members of the infected and those who are exposed to the virus during burials. In order for Liberia\u2019s Ebola outbreak to end, new hospital beds would have to be added, the study authors concluded. \n\u00a0\nLife or death decision on pregnant women\nHealth workers treating women with pregnancy-related problems in Ebola-hit countries have to make life or death decisions for their patients and themselves.\nHealth workers have very little time to decide whether a pregnant women with complications is free of Ebola and should have the necessary intervention, or may have Ebola and should have minimal procedures. This is according to experts in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. \nDr Benjamin Black, a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology, said poor infrastructure and limited access to laboratory services meant that test results for suspected Ebola patients could take more than 24 hours to arrive, in which time a woman and her foetus may die. \nHealth workers dealing with childbirth are at particular risk of infection because they are frequently exposed to large quantities of bodily fluids, including blood, urine and faeces. The survival rate from the virus for expectant mothers was virtually zero. Due to the stigma, rumours and fear surrounding Ebola, pregnant women often wait until they are in a critical state before seeking treatment, further challenging the system of prioritising patients, Black said.\n","field_image":"","nid":"5864","path":"/article/ebola-watch-0","created":"Monday, January 19, 2015 - 00:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"Fact Box","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"John Muchangi","body":"Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells.\n It can affect almost any part of the body. \nThe growths often invade surrounding tissue and can metastasize to distant sites. \nMany cancers can be prevented by avoiding exposure to common risk factors, such as tobacco smoke. \n","field_image":"","nid":"5866","path":"/article/fact-box","created":"Monday, January 19, 2015 - 00:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"Maternity centre in Kilifi delivers only one mother  ","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"BY ALPHONCE GARI","body":"Only one expectant mother at a time can deliver at an  independence-era maternity centre in Kilifi County.The Kakoneni maternal health facility in Kakoneni area, Malindi sub  County, was built during independence but has never been upgraded.   \nHealth personnel from Kakoneni say they receive many women during  prenatal visits, but when they are due, only one can be helped, at a  time.\nThe facility's clinical officer Edison Dagamra said at times they get more than 30 women who want to  deliver at the same old facility.\n\u201cAll expectant mothers in Kakoneni area rely on this small  maternity wing during delivery,\u2019\u2019 he says.\nThe authorities cannot handle the number of  expectant mothers, forcing them to deliver at  home, which is risky, he said.\nDagamra has now formed a team of community midwives to handle the deliveries.He says some women walk for more than 30 kilometres across the  river to seek maternal health services at Kakoneni.    \n\u201cThe community midwives have been of help in this area as they help us  deal with cases of delivery at home, we come in when there are  complications,\u2019\u2019 he says.\nThe traditional birth attendants are trained by  professional medical personnel.Dagamra asks the government to expand the maternity  wing to reduce the risks of maternal deaths.    \nMalindi MP Dan Kazungu who toured the area recently said his Constituency Development Fund  would set up a new maternity wing.\n Kilifi County has one of the highest number of maternal deaths in  Kenya, caused by lack of inadequate facilities.\nCounty executive officer in charge of health Dr Swabah Omar says:\n\u201cWe are very much concerned about the rising number of maternal  deaths in our county.

Sierra Leone, which last week overtook Liberia as the nation with the   most infections, counted 8,273 cases and 2,033 deaths on December 13. The toll up until December 10 stood at 8,069 cases and 1,899 deaths.\n Liberia, long the hardest-hit country, has meanwhile seen a decrease in the rate of transmission in recent weeks.

If  you are among the many Kenyans who can afford this, you may put on a  kilo or two by New Year's Day.    \nBut what is the harm in a little  Christmas binging, especially if the result is just a few kilos  gained?The problem is that research shows most  people may never lose the holiday weight, and eventually this  contributes to Kenya's growing burden of non-communicable diseases  like diabetes and fatal heart attacks.    \nA new \u201cmwananchi\u201d cookbook released  last week by the University of Nairobi's health specialists shows you  do not have to sacrifice your health at the altar of the Christmas  dinner table.\n\u201cBeing aware of what we eat,  understanding what is in the foods we eat, how we cook them and the  best way of maintaining the nutritional value of food is the first  step in the process,\u201d says the book \u2013 Community Recipes For  Every Day Living.   \nIt is a collection of the best recipes  from common dishes in Kibera slums and Githiga Village in Githunguri,  Kiambu County.Ordinary Kenyans who cannot afford the  refined foods that others gorge on during Christmas will find the  book very reassuring.       \nIt confirms the possibility that the slum-dweller enjoying well-prepared Ugali and Omena and the villager eating a  nutritious serving of Githeri Mukimo, are having a healthier Christmas than the man drowning in beer and meat at the office party.   \nIt recommends those \u201ctraditional\u201d  foods like managu (Africa black nightshade) and Mukimo, that Kenyans  ditch during festivities, and calls for restrained intake of refined  foods like pasta, white chapatis and alcoholic drinks among others.   \nUoN's  health policy and health  management lecturer and one of the book's authors, Dr Richard Ayah,  explains why they focused on recipes with locally available foods.   \n\u201c(In Kibera) residents mostly buy  their food from food vendors commonly  known as 'mama  mboga'.....fruits like pineapple and water melon are mostly cut into  smaller pieces and sold for between ten and 20 shillings as most  buyers can't afford to but an entire fruit,\u201d Dr Ayah says.   \nThe book therefore lacks the more  exotic foods like pomegranates, apples, beetroots and others peddled  on most recipes.The cookbook shows that it's possible  for slum dwellers to eat healthy meals without struggling to buy  exotic foods in supermarkets.       \nIt is the product of a months-long  project that comprised a survey and subsequent training programmes in  Kibera and Githunguri this year.   \nThe project, 'Improving Household  Decision Making For Healthier Lives', aimed at training decision  makers at home to make and serve healthy food.   \nThe survey results, released in  February this year, showed most households eat unhealthy foods,  leading to obesity in the most unlikely places - slums and rural  areas.\nMost people in the two survey areas did not know what  non-communicable diseases are, at 69.4 per cent in Githiga and 78.1  per cent in Kibera. Decisions on meals were therefore made made  without regard to nutrition.   \nWith funding from the Africa Capacity Alliance, the team from  UoN's clinical epidemiology unit and the Kenya Association of  Professional Counselors (KAPC) moved into Kibera and Githiga village  to teach women how to cook and serve healthier food.   \n\u201cMost people who are developing  obesity today are from good agricultural areas and have access to  healthy food,\u201d says Alice Ndong', one of the authors and a  nutritionist from the Technical University of Kenya.\nThe trainees then showcased their best  skills in cooking demos in Githiga and Kibera in March and the best   recipes were compiled into this book.   \nKAPC boss Cecilia Rachier, also a co-author, says it's not easy  for women to change their cooking methods. \u201cCooking is very  personal. Adopting new cooking methods is a slow process that  involves counseling,\u201d she says.   \nOther co-authors are Dr Erastus Njeru, director of clinical  epidemiology unit at the UoN's school of medicine, Kellen Karimi,  Joyce Olenja, Elias Gikundi and Samuel Obwanga.\nFrom Kibera, Resla Amoit's recipe of Ugali and Omena was picked as  the best and published in the book. The others are recipes of ugali  prepared with kunde, mrenda, beef-stew or sukuma wiki.\nMargaret Wambui produced the best recipe in Githunguri. The mother  of four prepared Githeri Mukimo and vegetable stew. Other recipes  from Githunguri are of Kitoweo, njahi with rice and fried beans.   \nThe book explains in simple words the different classification of  foods: carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and oils, and fats and oils.  \nAlthough most health fads malign carbohydrates as the bad guys of  nutrition, carbs are important sources of the energy and should  supply 40 to 60 per cent of all your caloric intake, the book says.   \nThey power the body's involuntary functions, including the heart  beat, breathing and digestive processes.Nutritionist Ndong says how food is served is as important as how  it's cooked.  \u201cBut the problem is that in Kenya people serve very  little vegetables to a plate full of Ugali,\u201d Ndong says.      \nToo much carbohydrates like Ugali, rice and chapatis, without  enough exercise, may easily lead to unnecessary fat gain. Having too  little, like in starvation, is also dangerous because the body uses  up the stored fat and afterwards begins \"eating\" internal  organs for energy. This can lead to heart failure or damaged kidneys,  liver and other organs.   \n\u201cWe cannot wait until people succumb  to these conditions...we have to prevent them by living a lifestyle  that is healthy,\u201d says the book.   \n","field_image":"","nid":"8342","path":"/article/kibera-recipe-book-out-time-christmas","created":"Monday, December 22, 2014 - 10:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"More centres opened to help women with fistula ","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"BY MATHEWS NDANYI","body":"The more than two million women in Kenya suffering from fistula complications face long delays before treatment due to a shortage of experts and facilities.\nFistula is a tear in a woman\u2019s bladder or rectum that causes leak in urine or feaces.\nThousands of new fistula cases are recorded among women every year with the main causes being prolonged labour, botched caesarean sections and sexual assault.\nMost of the victims suffer pain and stigma and many fear seeking treatment. Such cases are high in parts of North Rift, Western and Nyanza regions.\nBut there is now a glimmer of hope for the women in the region following the establishment of a fistula treatment centre in the region. It is located at the Kisumu East District hospital. Similar centres have been set up at the Cheranganyi Nursing home in Kitale and at the Jamaa Mission Hospital in Nairobi.\nThe Fistula Foundation has helped establish the centres. Lindsey Pollaczek, the foundation\u2019s programme director, says many affected women were forced to wait for the free medical camps organised once a year in Nairobi or Eldoret.\nJanet Anyango, 24, from Nyabondo in Kisumu County, says she has suffered fistula for the last 12 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so painful and stigmatising to live with the fistula condition.

Some even associate it with witchcraft and opt to try traditional ways of handling the problem.\nKerubo calls on those with the complication to seek for medical treatment.\nThe new fistula center has given hope to many women but the shortage of medics to handle the surgeries is still a major challenge.\nAccording to Habiba Mohamed, an outreach manager at the Fistula Foundation, the country has eight trained fistula surgeons and every year, they identify 500 new patients in the Western, Nyanza and sections of North rift. About 300 of them access treatment.\nNationally about 1,000 women are operated annually in some hospitals.

The three year initiative will run from this year to 2017 and will cost more than S 200 million.\nMore than 1,200 women will benefit from corrective surgery.\n","field_image":"","nid":"8622","path":"/article/more-centres-opened-help-women-fistula","created":"Monday, December 15, 2014 - 10:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"SLE -when we do not know what we do not know","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"DR RICHARD AYAH","body":"What is it that you think you know but in reality you do not really know? There must be many things. For example is the traffic in Nairobi City really real? Or is it artificially created? What about the handbag check at various entrances combined with the beep, beep of a metal detector? Does it really make us safer? In daily life so much happens that we rarely have enough time or resources to independently verify all the information that passes before our eyes. The problem is made worse by the human desire for as much certainty in any given situation. The solution then is to look for any evidence of incompetence or dishonesty.\nIf these traits are absent then we tend to trust the source of information and assume that since this is in their area of work they know something that we do not know and so take their advise and do what is asked. In such situations people who are very confident have a big advantage over everyone else; in that people who are extremely confident are believed more often than those who display less confidence.\nBut the basic problem of the reliability of the information remains irrespective of how it is delivered. Is it really true that handbag checks reduce terrorist activity? Is it really true that the way we manage our motor vehicles helps reduce road collisions while enhancing movement? Such questions should really be answered with proper evidence that can be verified independently.\nWithout such evidence we have a lot of activity some of which can be harmful to society happening in the name of protecting that very same society. In a way society then behaves the way a body does when it has systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE for short.\nSLE is one of the most common of a group of systemic autoimmune diseases, where the body\u2019s immune system is unable to tell the difference between foreign dangerous things like virus and bacteria and instead attack the body\u2019s own normal health tissue. The word \u2018lupus\u2019 is originally Latin for \u2018wolf\u2019 and when Europeans first began to recognize the disease as a distinct entity, they thought that it was caused by the bite of a wolf because of a distinct butterfly like rash that appears on the cheeks of the face that on healing leaves what looks like bite marks.\nWe do not have wolves in Africa, except a species in Ethiopia, the jackal is the African counterpart, and it is interesting that SLE more commonly affects non-Caucasian women aged 15 to 35 years. The exact cause of SLE is not known but it is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors at play. When a person develops SLE the body\u2019s immune system does not recognise the markers that identify what is self and so attacks the skin, kidneys, joints and even the brain. The attacked organs are inflamed and so swell, causing severe pain and functions are impaired.\nThe course of the disease is unpredictable and the person with SLE can have long periods of remission then episodes of intense disease.\nDiagnosing SLE is difficult. Being female aged 15 to 40 years and being of non-Caucasian descent are the known major risk factors. Further the signs and symptoms are not specific affecting multiple organs at different times in the same person, sometimes overlapping with no two people having the exact same symptoms and there is no specific laboratory test for the disease. As you can imagine it is the body attacking itself. So combinations of tests are done including blood, urine and x-rays checks in addition to a proper history and physical examination by a doctor.\nComplications of SLE include serious kidney, lung and heart damage, so that the patient develops related symptoms such as leg swelling, difficulty in breathing, nausea, vomiting and even stroke and brain seizures. SLE sufferers are also vulnerable to infection because their immune system is so intent on destroying the body rather than focusing on the enemy from outside. There is no cure for SLE, treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms, inflammation is reduced using non-steroidal analgesics from the aspirin family, steroids for severe cases, some cancer drugs have been shown to help but side effects can be just as bad.\nBecause many diseases in medical school are named from western culture, we sometimes fail to recognise them in our own communities. Perhaps if SLE was named after the jackal we might recognise it more and figure out what to do.\nThe jackal is known to be cunning, sly and interested only in its own survival. We know where to find it and can relate the habits and behaviour of a jackal compared to the foreigner wolf, which we come across mainly in movies. That might sound like a call to the \u2018good old days\u2019 when African life was perfect, but in fact is a call to adapt to the global world of today where education and information are the key to building a healthy prosperous society. Ignorance is what leads the body to attack itself.\n","field_image":"","nid":"8624","path":"/article/sle-when-we-do-not-know-what-we-do-not-know","created":"Monday, December 15, 2014 - 10:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"Girl commits suicide after forced FGM","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"BY MARRYANN CHAI","body":"A schoolgirl committed suicide after being forced to undergo female genital mutilation, according to a winning poster in an awareness campaign.\nThe poster was drawn by Consolatah Lokiru from Ortum Girls School.

But that could be the tip of the iceberg, an official at the UN health agency said. This assessment was based on the knowledge that the fatality rate in the epidemic stands at about 70 percent. \nDye said the likely explanation was that many people were burying the dead in secret, possibly to avoid having authorities interfere with burial customs like washing and touching the deceased widely blamed for much of the transmission. Even though the spread of the virus has slowed in Liberia, where 2,697 people had died out of a total of 6,525 cases, officials warned that this is no time for complacency.\n\u00a0\nKenyans to volunteer for vaccine tests\nIn the next few weeks 100 healthy Kenyans will be asked to volunteer to take part in Ebola vaccine trials, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) has said. A statement posted by the Kemri-Wellcome Trust Research Programme says the trials of the vaccine developed by Canadians have already started in the US and preparations for Kenya, Gabon, Germany and Switzerland are being made. \nThe exercise to be overseen by the World Health Organisation will vaccinate 335 healthy volunteers starting with 20 in Germany, followed by 100 each in Gabon and Kenya and 115 in Switzerland, if the trials proceed as planned. WHO said some of those expected to volunteer are health workers who will travel to West Africa to help fight the disease.\nThe Canadian vaccine, rVSV-EBOV, to be tested in Kenya, has so far only been tested in monkeys. Wellcome Trust last week contributed $5 million (Sh448.9 million) to finance the trials. Researchers are trying to determine the safety of the vaccines and correct dosage.\n\u00a0\nWHO introduces new burial rules for victims\nA new WHO protocol for safe and dignified burial of people who die from Ebola virus disease emphasizes inclusion of family members and encouraging religious rites as an essential part of safe burials. \nAt least 20 per cent of new Ebola infections occur during burials of deceased Ebola patients. By building trust and respect between burial teams, bereaved families and religious groups, trust and safety is being build in the response itself. \nIntroducing components such as inviting the family to be involved in digging the grave and offering options for dry ablution and shrouding will make a significant difference in curbing Ebola transmission. \nEbola infections occur during burials when family and community members perform religious rites that require directly touching or washing the body, which still contains high levels of Ebola virus; and when family members distribute personal property of the loved one, which may be infected with the virus.\nDeveloped by an interdisciplinary team at WHO, in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and faith-based organizations including World Council of Churches, Islamic Relief, Caritas Internationalis and World Vision, this updated protocol outlines step-by-step processes for safe and dignified burials. \n","field_image":"","nid":"11165","path":"/article/ebola-watch-1","created":"Monday, November 17, 2014 - 00:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"HEALTH DIARY","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"John Muchangi","body":"Kenyans will mark the World Toilet Day on Wednesday this week. \n\u201cEquality and Dignity\u201d is the theme for this year.

Tabitha Ibeere has to go through this same process every morning where in a few minutes smoke begins to fill the kitchen, which has one small window to act as a source of ventilation.\nShe has to squint to prevent her eyes from tearing. She can't let this slow her down, she must prepare breakfast before her children awake and her husband gets back from delivering milk. Her husband arrives and Tabitha has to take his breakfast to him, he doesn't like eating in the kitchen and in fact he rarely enters it.\nHe expects his wife to handle all matters involving the kitchen and if he ever wants anything he only needs to call out her name. The process of preparing meals accompanied by hours of blowing into a metal cylinder just to keep the embers from dying out, isn't his concern as is seen in most traditional African cultures. He does however, notice that his wife is coughing as she serves him breakfast, he assumes it must be the cold and advises her to wear a warmer sweater.\nTabitha's children are by now awake and fully dressed for school, they unlike their father prefer to have their meals in the kitchen right next to their mother who's much more tolerant of their playful ways. The first born is six years old, he doesn't mind the smoke in the kitchen that much. He's used to it by now, what he does mind is the smell of smoke on his clothes.\nBefore, he would be forced to hang his school sweater outside for aeration every evening, he's wiser now. He simply doesn't wear his sweater until he's about to leave for school, this is despite the chilly morning weather. Dennis figures he's better off that way, he doesn't want to be teased at school. \"Some of my friends use stoves in their homes and as such tease the rest of us who come in smelling like smoke,\" Dennis said.\nOnce his done, he quickly runs out of the kitchen and one is left wondering if he's simply excited to be going to school or just to be out of the smoke filled kitchen with soot covering its walls.\nThis leaves Tabitha with Joyce, her four year old daughter, her husband has long since gone to work in the nearby quarry. The two have a long day ahead of them, they have to trek to their farm and back. They, however, must return by 1pm not just for lunch but to prepare for the evening. On their way back, they gather firewood some of which the little girl carries in an attempt of lightening her mother's load. She understands from an early age that this is the role her community has assigned to women.\nSide by side, mother and daughter sit preparing that evening's meal that's until Joyce starts coughing. The cough doesn't abate and soon a wheeze can be heard. Her mother tells her to go wear a sweater and stay in the main house where the smoke won't aggravate her cough. This has happened before, Tabitha thinks it's simply a reaction to the cold evening weather as it only presents in the early morning hours or late evening. It's not just a cold.\nSon and husband eventually return, hungry for their evening meal. Tabitha spends over six hours in her kitchen, she has accepted this as her way of life. But as I left, I asked what she wished life was different, her response, \"No, I only wish it was better.\"\nWe often approach, indoor air pollution as a public health issue and rightly so. The health issues surrounding traditional cooking methods that utilize firewood, coal are numerous: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, lung and respiratory system diseases among others. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly four million people worldwide die prematurely from illnesses attributable to indoor air pollution.\nAs Dr Jared Mecha, a consultant on respiratory diseases in the School of Medicine, University of Nairobi, has not been spared. \"When it comes to indoor air pollution, we have a long way to go more so in the rural setting. It's not simply a matter of raising awareness but providing solutions that are relevant to the community,\" he said. \" We have to be practical in the options we present. You have to factor in the social, economic and cultural aspects as well.\"\nThis is a message that came across going through a day in the life of Tabitha Ibeere, who like many women in her setting, provision of better cooking technologies isn't simply a matter of improving livelihoods but of empowering women as well.\nAn initiative taken up by the Global Alliance for clean stoves and echoed by the work of the Kenya Medical Research Institute by formation of partnerships that strive to lower indoor pollution in households in rural Kenya.

Experts now warn that eating the right kinds of foods is imperative during cancer treatment.\nUniversity of Nairobi's lecturer and oncologist Dr Gladwell Kiarie says that exercise and drinking water are two sure ways of good recuperation during treatment.\n\"Cancer has been known to affect a large number of people across the globe, therefore when one is diagnosed with the disease they must stick to good nutrition and exercise,\" she says.\nSurvivors must also work to reduce alkalinity by increasing the amount of oxygen supply in the body. The oxygen supply can be increased through breathing techniques, meditation and exercise, Dr Kiarie says.\n\u201cWater and exercise are essential in the diet for cancer patients. Oxygen and water are the first two foods for the cells of the body. Without oxygen no cell can survive and the food eaten will not benefit the body if there is not enough oxygen is to break it down. Cancer can only exist in a body where oxygen supply is minimum,\u201d she says.\nDaily breathing in the open air is an absolute necessity to increase the body\u2019s oxygen. Every cancer patient should learn some breathing techniques.\nExercise pumps the lymph system and helps get toxins out of the body. Lifting about six kilogrammes of weights for 10 minutes while sitting on a chair will help a great deal. Every cancer patient should drink as much natural water as they can, up to about four litres a day, she adds.\nCancer thrives in low amounts of oxygen and high acidity in the body. This environment allows the growth of bacteria, virus and fungus in the body and eventually a cancerous growth manifests.\nNormally, the natural blood PH of a healthy individual is 7.4, but in a cancer patient the blood PH is about 6.5. The 7.4 PH is when the blood is alkaline or balanced between acidity and base.\n\u201cIts progression in the cells takes long and can be tamed at early stages, but Kenyan women are shying away from early screening,\u201d says David Makumi, the head of the Kenya Cancer Association (Kencasa), in a past interview.\nKencasa says cancer is the third highest cause of morbidity in Kenya, after infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases.\u201cAn estimated 39,000 new cases of cancer each year are reported in Kenya with more than 27,000 deaths per year,\u201d says the association.\nDr Kiarie warns a balanced diet and lots of water is a must.\nShe says every food can be categorised into three main categories: those that cause cancer, those that interfere with the cancer treatment and those that distract the immunity system hence weakening the body in the fight against cancer.\nThe foods that cause cancer include most foods with Trans fatty acids like margarine, all deep fried foods, aspartame such as diet coke and virtually every other processed foods, and food with MSG polyunsaturated oils. The most common is corn oil. The more reason why all the chips, burger and pizza you eat is a step closer to cancer, Dr Kiarie says.\nThe other category is food that directly interferes with treatments for cancer by feeding and strengthening the cancer cells and body. These are foods rich in chlorine, fluoride, alcohol, sugar and coffee. Sugar and all acidic foods also deplete the body of key minerals and other nutrients because of its acidity. The acidity causes the body to use up the minerals to regulate the PH level in the body. The reaction caused in the body by these acidic foods is the major contributing factor to most chronic diseases, including cancer.\nAnd the last category is food that occupies and distracts the immunity system from focusing on killing the cancer cells. Most types of meat would fall under this category especially beef and chicken and this why most cancer patients do not enjoy the famous nyama choma.\n\u201cGood eating habits of a balanced diet must be observed by a cancer patient, but the food should be in small proportions for about five times a day,\u201d she says.\n\u201cHowever if a patient is going through chemotherapy or radio therapy then he or she is given vitamins in small quantities so they have the energy required.\u201d\nSmoking and alcohol should be avoided at all costs, she warns. Smoking puts more than 100 carcinogens in the body while tobacco is also very high in sugar, fungi and yeast. Part of this is because the tobacco leaves are processed. Alcohol should also be avoided because it is primarily a mycotoxin which interferes with all cancer treatment plans. Research has also shown than alcohol when taken by adults over prolonged periods increased the chances of their children getting childhood Leukemia.\n\u201cPeople should avoid bad eating habits, large amounts of alcohol and smoking as this deteriorates a patient's health. However little amounts have not been reported as harmful,\u201d she states.\nCaffeine should also be avoided because it restricts the blood vessels, meaning less oxygen gets to the cancer cells. It is also acidic-forming. This also includes chocolate because it also has some caffeine.\nThe foundation of a good diet for cancer patients includes a variety of green vegetables and sprouts. Food high in fibre, enzymes, chlorophyll, minerals and many nutrients are also necessary for the cancer patient\u2019s diet. Juicing vegetables and grasses will help get more nutrients into the body. However, some whole vegetables should be eaten in order to get the fibre essential in the treatment of cancer. Cook vegetables until they are three quarter done, meaning they still have that green look.\nDr Kiarie advises that juices should be made from the actual foods and should be drunk immediately after they are prepared. In cases where many small doses of the fresh vegetables juice are needed, the juice can be refrigerated during the day, according to various online resources.\n\"Essentially, one should have fresh juice made from organic fruits as far as possible, fresh salads, vegetables, juiced greens and sprouts as part of the main meals,\" she adds.\n","field_image":"","nid":"14394","path":"/article/why-proper-nutrition-cancer-patients-crucial","created":"Monday, September 8, 2014 - 00:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"Kenyan scientist turns to herbs for antibiotic","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"BY HENRY WANYAMA","body":"A Kenyan scientist is working a new antibiotic made from herbal extracts.\nEgerton University's Prof Josephat Matasyoh is the lead researcher in theherbal drug that may come into actual use after three years.\nAntibiotics work by blocking vital processes in bacteria, killing the bacteria, or stopping them from multiplying.\nThe project aims at increasing antibiotics production by pharmaceutical companies.\nMatasyoh said: \u201cMany pharmaceutical companies stopped the production of antibiotics for the last 15 years arguing that it is expensive yet there is no much money made out of them.\u201d\nHe said since 1999, most drugs companies turned focus on production of drugs for non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension, which are used for life, thus guaranteeing life-long market, as opposed to infectious diseases like typhoid and cholera, which take five days to cure. \n\u201cBacteria for neglected diseases in the body have a sense of communication to multiply.

After graduation, there are still bills to pay. Now, imagine you have to deal with all these yet you won't receive your salary in the first month of working or the second, but at the end of the third month paid in bulk. There you are, facing three months of work without pay or better yet, delayed pay. You have been posted to a remote area or simply an unfamiliar region, you have to look for accommodation, somehow furnish it and for the next three months manage to survive. You are left with the option of either once again seeking your parents assistance or actually taking out a loan to keep you going till then.\nThis is the life of an intern doctor who recently graduated from medical school and has just been posted to a hospital for their internship.\nBut what is the difference in the titles doctors must go through in their professional journey? Upon graduation, a medical student acquires the title doctor and a temporary internship licence. In essence this means that they are qualified by the virtue of going through a minimum of five to six years in school, but they require training or rather need to gather work experience before they receive a permanent licence, which would allow them to venture into private practice.\nTherefore, in Kenya by law, you must undergo one year of internship. Upon completion, the intern becomes a medical officer with a licence to practice. The government at this point, reserves the right to once again post you to a different institution from your internship station. It is after this period that once can apply for a Masters degree in the varied fields in medicine. While undertaking the further studies, the doctor is then referred to as a registrar and upon graduation, the doctor becomes a consultant, indicating specialisation. The journey between intern doctor, medical officer, registrar and consultant spans over six years and could even over a decade. The first step, however, is that one year right after graduation when you become an intern doctor and equally that's when most problems are.\nMost undergraduate medical students graduate in December. However, they are posted to work in April. Previously, before 2011, the interns were sent out in January. Therefore, you have three months before you start working and when you do begin, you are expected to go another three months without receiving payment. This is despite the fact that you work over 100 hours in a week, which in itself surpasses the labour laws. A close examination of most of the public hospitals in Kenya shows that most of the work is relegated to the intern doctors. The reasoning behind it being that the whole purpose of an internship period is to acquire as much as experience as possible. Their immediate supervisors being the medical officers. In some of the stations, intern doctors have to work weekend shifts that might include working all day and night, with the only sleeping time being the few hours nap you might get if the hospital isn't too busy, and the four hours of sleep on Sunday night before reporting for work on Monday morning at 8am.\nIt is no surprise that the 2014 group of intern doctors are currently on a go slow that was initiated on August 14. The cause behind it being that, during their posting in April it was agreed that they would be paid end of July, the first month of the financial year 2014/2015.\nHowever, on July 16, two weeks before pay day, the office of the Health Principal  Secretary sent out a memo stating that they would carry out an auditing process as they process salaries. They intended to do a head count of the interns in their different stations all over Kenya. There are approximately 70 stations. By August 4, no payment had been made. A memo was sent out stating interns would be paid by August 13, despite an agreement that payment would be end of July. The first batch of payment was on August 11 but this covered less than 20 per cent of the interns. On August 19 there was a meeting held at the Ministry of Health and a resolution was that all remaining interns would be paid by Monday, August 25. Another meeting was held the following day, issues raised: Why hadn't all interns been paid?\nThe response was that the delay was in Treasury not the Ministry of Health. But wasn't it the responsibility of the Ministry of Health to look after their people? In addition, they had removed their non-practice allowance. The interns are not allowed to have private practice. Were they not going to be paid for all the extra hours spent in public institutions?\n\"We the doctors have been stretched beyond reasonable doubt at this point. Furthermore our non-practice allowance has been slashed and it is unacceptable. The Kenya Medical practitioners pharmacists and dentists union KMPDU is in agreement and supports us. In the end it's not just us getting the raw deal but the common mwananchi as well,\" said Mwachonda Hamisi, the interns committee union representative.\nIt's now going to six months, not all intern doctors have been paid and none has received the appropriate payment. If that's not enough, now some medical officers in certain counties such as Mombasa are adding their voice that they too haven't been paid. While intern doctors fall under the central government, the medical doctors fall under the county governments. But the problems are the same and as Steve Nigel, an intern doctor from Kilifi District Hospital, said: \"There is need for review. We should either have double intake into the system as there are now more medical schools or early factoring in all incoming interns in the budget with clear guidelines on payment.\u201d\n","field_image":"","nid":"15479","path":"/article/why-intern-doctors-really-went-strike","created":"Monday, September 1, 2014 - 00:00","status":"Yes"}},{"node":{"title":"Kenyan kids take part in trial to trap malaria parasite","Tag":"Health & Fitness","field_author":"BY MANUEL ODENY","body":"About 140 Kenyan children took part in  a pioneer research that discovered a protein that is essential in making a  malaria vaccine.\nThe blood samples, which were  collected way back in 1997, were used by Rhode Island Hospital researchers to  help correlate a similar research of 785 Tanzanian children carried out in  2002.\nAntibodies to this protein trap  the parasite inside these red blood cells which could lead to the development  of a vaccine that would prevent the progression of Plasmodium falciparum  malaria.\nThe research by Jonathan Kurtis,  the director of the Center for International Health Research in the American hospital and  his colleagues, is \u00a0published in the May  23 issue of journal Science. \nKurtis said the research  intensified six years ago when they began using \u00a0samples to identify novel vaccine candidates.\n\u201cWhile a portion of this research  was conducted in mice, the actual vaccine discovery experiments were performed  using human samples, thus we believe the results will effectively translate to  humans,\" he said in the research.\nIn the mouse experiments,  researchers conducted five independent vaccine trials in which mice were  vaccinated with the novel antigen, which they have designated as Schizont  Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1) or control. \nAll mice were then challenged  with malaria parasites. \nIn all five experiments,  vaccinated mice had lower levels of malaria parasites and survived longer than  the unvaccinated mice.\n\"We discovered that  antibodies to this protein, PfSEA-1, effectively trapped the malaria-causing  parasite within the red blood cells, it was truly a moment of discovery,'\"  Kurtis said. \nCurrent research to get a vaccine  seek to prevent the virus from entering the red blood cell, but this pioneer  study has found a way to block it from leaving the cell once it has entered. \n\u201cIf it's trapped in the red blood  cell, it can't go anywhere\u2026 it can't do any further damage,\" the research read.\nKurtis said they will need more  trials in animals and human samples and see the protein as \u201ca potential vaccine  candidate to prevent this infectious disease that kills millions of children  every year.\"\n\u00a0\n","field_image":"","nid":"15481","path":"/article/kenyan-kids-take-part-trial-trap-malaria-parasite","created":"Monday, September 1, 2014 - 00:00","status":"Yes"}}]}
